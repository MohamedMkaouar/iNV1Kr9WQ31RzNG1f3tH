In the United States, there are several vaccines to prevent COVID-19. Some have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Others are being used under Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) from the FDA. All of these vaccines have met the FDA's scientific standards for safety, effectiveness, and manufacturing quality needed to support authorization or approval.\\nThis page includes details about the vaccines and the vaccination program, including where you can find a vaccine.\\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention\\n\",\n",
       " 'Transient Ischemic Attack': '\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nA transient ischemic attack (TIA) is a stroke that lasts only a few minutes. It happens when the blood supply to part of the brain is briefly blocked. Symptoms of a TIA are like other stroke symptoms, but do not last as long. They happen suddenly, and include:\\nNumbness or weakness, especially on one side of the body\\nConfusion or trouble speaking or understanding speech\\nTrouble seeing in one or both eyes\\nDifficulty walking\\nDizziness\\nLoss of balance or coordination\\n\\nMost symptoms of a TIA disappear within an hour, although they may last for up to 24 hours. Because you cannot tell if these symptoms are from a TIA or a stroke, you should go to the hospital right away.\\nTIAs are often a warning sign for future strokes. Taking medicine, such as blood thinners, may reduce your risk of a stroke. Your doctor might also recommend surgery. You can also help lower your risk by having a healthy lifestyle. This includes not smoking, not drinking too much, eating a healthy diet, and exercising. It is also important to control other health problems, such as high blood pressure and cholesterol.\\nNIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke\\n',\n",
       " 'Inhalation Injuries': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nInhalation injuries are acute injuries to your respiratory system and lungs. They can happen if you breathe in toxic substances, such as smoke (from fires), chemicals, particle pollution, and gases. Inhalation injuries can also be caused by extreme heat; these are a type of thermal injuries. Over half of deaths from fires are due to inhalation injuries.\\nSymptoms of inhalation injuries can depend on what you breathed in. But they often include:\\nCoughing and phlegm\\nA scratchy throat\\nIrritated sinuses\\nShortness of breath\\nChest pain or tightness\\nHeadaches\\nStinging eyes\\nA runny nose\\n\\nIf you have a chronic heart or lung problem, an inhalation injury can make it worse.\\nTo make a diagnosis, your health care provider may use a scope to look at your airways and check for damage. Other possible tests include imaging tests of the lungs, blood tests, and lung function tests.\\nIf you have an inhalation injury, your health care provider will make sure that your airway is not blocked. Treatment is with oxygen therapy, and in some cases, medicines. Some patients need to use a ventilator to breathe. Most people get better, but some people have permanent lung or breathing problems. Smokers and people who had a severe injury are at a greater risk of having permanent problems.\\nYou can take steps to try to prevent inhalation injuries:\\nAt home, practice fire safety, which includes preventing fires and having a plan in case there is a fire\\nIf there is smoke from a wildfire nearby or lots of particulate pollution in the air, try to limit your time outdoors. Keep your indoor air as clean as possible, by keeping windows closed and using an air filter. If you have asthma, another lung disease, or heart disease, follow your health care provider's advice about your medicines and respiratory management plan.\\nIf you are working with chemicals or gases, handle them safely and use protective equipment\\n\\n\",\n",
       " 'Neuroblastoma': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nWhat is neuroblastoma?\\nNeuroblastoma is a type of cancer that forms in nerve cells called neuroblasts. Neuroblasts are immature nerve tissue. They normally turn into working nerve cells. But in neuroblastoma, they form a tumor.\\nNeuroblastoma usually begins in the adrenal glands. You have two adrenal glands, one on top of each kidney. The adrenal glands make important hormones that help control heart rate, blood pressure, blood sugar, and the way the body reacts to stress. Neuroblastoma may also begin in the neck, chest or spinal cord.\\nWhat causes neuroblastoma?\\nNeuroblastoma is caused by mutations (changes) in genes. In most cases, the cause of the mutation is unknown. In some other cases, the mutation is passed from the parent to the child.\\nWhat are the symptoms of neuroblastoma?\\nNeuroblastoma often begins in early childhood. Sometimes it begins before a child is born.The most common symptoms are caused by the tumor pressing on nearby tissues as it grows or by cancer spreading to the bone.They include:\\nA lump in the abdomen, neck or chest\\nBulging eyes\\nDark circles around the eyes\\nBone pain\\nSwollen stomach and trouble breathing in babies\\nPainless, bluish lumps under the skin in babies\\nInability to move a body part (paralysis)\\n\\nHow is neuroblastoma diagnosed?\\nTo diagnose neuroblastoma, your child's health care provider will do various tests and procedures, which may include:\\nA medical history\\nA neurological exam\\nImaging tests, such as x-rays, a CT scan, an ultrasound, an MRI, or an MIBG scan. In an MIBG scan, a small amount of a radioactive substance is injected into a vein. It travels through the bloodstream and attaches itself to any neuroblastoma cells. A scanner detects the cells.\\nBlood and urine tests\\nBiopsy, where a sample of tissue is removed and examined under a microscope\\nBone marrow aspiration and biopsy, where bone marrow, blood, and a small piece of bone are removed for testing\\n\\nWhat are the treatments for neuroblastoma?\\nThe treatments for neuroblastoma include:\\nObservation, also called watchful waiting, where the health care provider does not give any treatments until your child's signs or symptoms appear or change\\nSurgery\\nRadiation therapy\\nChemotherapy\\nHigh-dose chemotherapy and radiation therapy with stem cell rescue. Your child will get high doses of chemotherapy and radiation. This kills the cancer cells, but it also kills healthy cells. So your child will get a stem cell transplant, usually of his or her own cells collected earlier. This helps to replace the healthy cells that were lost.\\nIodine 131-MIBG therapy, a treatment with radioactive iodine. The radioactive iodine collects in neuroblastoma cells and kills them with the radiation that is given off.\\nTargeted therapy, which uses drugs or other substances that attack specific cancer cells with less harm to normal cells\\n\\nNIH: National Cancer Institute\\n\",\n",
       " 'Sudden Cardiac Arrest': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nWhat is sudden cardiac arrest (SCA)?\\nSudden cardiac arrest (SCA) is a condition in which the heart suddenly stops beating. When that happens, blood stops flowing to the brain and other vital organs. If it is not treated, SCA usually causes death within minutes. But quick treatment with a defibrillator may be lifesaving.\\nHow is sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) different from a heart attack?\\nA heart attack is different from an SCA. A heart attack happens when blood flow to the heart is blocked. During a heart attack, the heart usually doesn't suddenly stop beating. With an SCA, the heart stops beating.\\nSometimes an SCA can happen after or during recovery from a heart attack.\\nWhat causes sudden cardiac arrest (SCA)?\\nYour heart has an electrical system that controls the rate and rhythm of your heartbeat.  An SCA can happen when the heart's electrical system is not working right and causes irregular heartbeats. Irregular heartbeats are called arrhythmias. There are different types. They may cause the heart to beat too fast, too slow, or with an irregular rhythm. Some can cause the heart to stop pumping blood to the body; this is the type that causes SCA.\\nCertain diseases and conditions can cause the electrical problems that lead to SCA. They include:\\nVentricular fibrillation, a type of arrhythmia where the ventricles (the heart's lower chambers) don't beat normally. Instead, they beat very fast and very irregularly. They can't pump blood to the body. This causes most SCAs.\\nCoronary artery disease (CAD), also called ischemic heart disease. CAD happens when the arteries of the heart cannot deliver enough oxygen-rich blood to the heart. It is often caused by the buildup of plaque, a waxy substance, inside the lining of larger coronary arteries. The plaque blocks some or all of the blood flow to the heart.\\nSome types of physical stress can cause your heart's electrical system to fail, such as\\n\\t\\nIntense physical activity in which your body releases the hormone adrenaline. This hormone can trigger SCA in people who have heart problems.\\nVery low blood levels of potassium or magnesium. These minerals play an important role in your heart's electrical system.\\nMajor blood loss\\nSevere lack of oxygen\\n\\n\\nCertain inherited disorders which can cause arrhythmias or problems with the structure of your heart\\nStructural changes in the heart, such as an enlarged heart due to high blood pressure or advanced heart disease. Heart infections can also cause changes to the structure of the heart.\\n\\nWho is at risk for sudden cardiac arrest (SCA)?\\nYou are at higher risk for SCA if you:\\nHave coronary artery disease (CAD). Most people with SCA have CAD. But CAD usually doesn't cause symptoms, so they may not know that they have it.\\nAre older; your risk increases with age\\nAre a man; it is more common in men than women\\nAre Black or African American, especially if you have other conditions such as diabetes, high blood pressure, heart failure, or chronic kidney disease\\nHave a personal history of heartbeats that aren't regular (arrhythmia)\\nHave a personal or family history of SCA or inherited disorders that can cause arrhythmia\\nHave a problem with drug or alcohol use\\nHave had a heart attack\\nHave heart failure\\n\\nWhat are the symptoms of sudden cardiac arrest (SCA)?\\nUsually, the first sign of SCA is loss of consciousness (fainting). This happens when the heart stops beating.\\nSome people may have a racing heartbeat or feel dizzy or light-headed just before they faint. And sometimes people have chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea, or vomiting in the hour before they have an SCA.\\nHow is sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) diagnosed?\\nSCA happens without warning and requires emergency treatment. Health care providers rarely diagnose SCA with medical tests as it's happening. Instead, it is usually diagnosed after it happens. Providers do this by ruling out other causes of a person's sudden collapse.\\nIf you are at high risk for SCA, your provider may refer you to a cardiologist, a doctor who specializes in heart diseases. The cardiologist may ask you to get various heart health tests to see how well you heart is working. He or she will work with you to decide whether you need treatment to prevent SCA.\\nWhat are the treatments for sudden cardiac arrest (SCA)?\\nSCA is an emergency. A person having SCA needs to be treated with a defibrillator right away. A defibrillator is a device sends an electric shock to the heart. The electric shock can restore a normal rhythm to a heart that's stopped beating. To work well, it needs to be done within minutes of the SCA.\\nMost police officers, emergency medical technicians, and other first responders are trained and equipped to use a defibrillator. Call 9-1-1 right away if someone has signs or symptoms of SCA. The sooner you call for help, the sooner lifesaving treatment can begin.\\nWhat should I do if I think that someone has had an SCA?\\nMany public places such as schools, businesses, and airports have automated external defibrillators (AEDs). AEDs are special defibrillators that untrained people can use if they think that someone has had SCA. AEDS are programmed to give an electric shock if they detect a dangerous arrhythmia. This prevents giving a shock to someone who may have fainted but isn't having SCA.\\nIf you see someone who you think has had SCA, you should give cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) until defibrillation can be done.\\nPeople who are at risk for SCA may want to consider having an AED at home. Ask your cardiologist to help you decide whether having an AED in your home might help you.\\nWhat are the treatments after surviving sudden cardiac arrest (SCA)?\\nIf you survive SCA, you'll likely be admitted to a hospital for ongoing care and treatment. In the hospital, your medical team will closely watch your heart. They may give you medicines to try to reduce the risk of another SCA.\\nThey will also try to find out what caused your SCA. If you're diagnosed with coronary artery disease, you may have an angioplasty or coronary artery bypass surgery. These procedures help restore blood flow through narrowed or blocked coronary arteries.\\nOften, people who have had SCA get a device called an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD). This small device is surgically placed under the skin in your chest or abdomen. An ICD uses electric pulses or shocks to help control dangerous arrhythmias.\\nCan sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) be prevented?\\nYou may be able to lower your risk of SCA by following a heart-healthy lifestyle. If you have coronary artery disease or another heart disease, treating that disease can also lower your risk of SCA. If you have had an SCA, getting an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) can lower your chance of having another SCA.\\nNIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute\\n\",\n",
       " 'Nutrition': '\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nFood provides the energy and nutrients you need to be healthy. Nutrients include proteins, carbohydrates, fats, vitamins, minerals, and water. \\nHealthy eating is not hard. The key is to:\\n\\tEat a variety of foods, including vegetables, fruits, and whole-grain products\\n\\tEat lean meats, poultry, fish, beans, and low-fat dairy products \\n\\tDrink lots of water\\n\\tLimit salt, sugar, alcohol, saturated fat, and trans fat in your diet\\n\\nSaturated fats are usually fats that come from animals. Look for trans fat on the labels of processed foods, margarines, and shortenings.\\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention \\n',\n",
       " 'Spinal Muscular Atrophy': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nWhat is spinal muscular atrophy (SMA)?\\nSpinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a group of genetic diseases that damages and kills motor neurons. Motor neurons are a type of nerve cell in the spinal cord and lower part of the brain. They control movement in your arms, legs, face, chest, throat, and tongue.\\nAs the motor neurons die off, your muscles start to weaken and atrophy (waste away). The muscle damage gets worse over time and can affect speaking, walking, swallowing, and breathing.\\nWhat are the types of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) and what are their symptoms?\\nThere are different types of SMA. They are based on how serious the disease is and when the symptoms start:\\nType l is also called Werdnig-Hoffman disease or infantile-onset SMA. It is the most severe type. It is also the most common. Babies with this type usually show signs of the disease before 6 months of age. In more severe cases, the signs show up even before or just after birth (Types 0 or 1A). The babies may have trouble swallowing and breathing and may not move around a lot. They have chronic shortening of muscles or tendons (called contractures). They usually cannot sit up without help. Without treatment, many children with this type will die before 2 years of age.\\nType ll is a moderate to severe type of SMA. It usually first noticed between 6 and 18 months of age. Most children with this type can sit without support but cannot stand or walk without help. They may also have trouble breathing. They can usually live into adolescence or young adulthood.\\nType lll is also called Kugelberg-Welander disease. It is the mildest type that affects children. The signs of the disease usually show up after age 18 months. Children with this type can walk by themselves but may have trouble running, getting up from a chair, or climbing stairs. They may also have scoliosis (curvature of the spine), contractures, and respiratory infections. With treatment, most children with this type will have a normal lifespan.\\nType IV is rare and often mild. It usually causes symptoms after 21 years of age. The symptoms include mild to moderate leg muscle weakness, tremors, and mild breathing problems. The symptoms slowly get worse over time. People with this type of SMA have a normal lifespan.\\n\\nWhat causes spinal muscular atrophy (SMA)?\\nMost types of SMA are caused by a change in the SMN1 gene. This gene is responsible for making a protein that the motor neurons need to be healthy and to function. But when part of the SMN1 gene is missing or abnormal, there isn't enough protein for the motor neurons. This causes the motor neurons to die off.\\nMost people have two copies of the SM1 gene - one from each parent. SMA normally only happens when both copies have the gene change. If only one copy has the change, there usually aren't any symptoms. But that gene could be passed down from parent to child.\\nSome of the less common types of SMA may be caused by changes in other genes.\\nHow is spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) diagnosed?\\nYour health care provider may use many tools to diagnose SMA:\\nA physical exam\\nA medical history, including asking about family history\\nGenetic testing to check for the gene changes that cause SMA\\nElectromyography and nerve conduction studies and a muscle biopsy may be done, especially if no gene changes were found\\n\\nParents who have a family history of SMA may want to do a prenatal test to check to see whether their baby has an SMN1 gene change. An amniocentesis or in some cases a chorionic villi sampling (CVS) is used to get the sample for testing.\\nIn some states, genetic testing for SMA is part of newborn screening tests.\\nWhat are the treatments for spinal muscular atrophy (SMA)?\\nThere is no cure for SMA. Treatments can help manage symptoms and prevent complications. They may include:\\nMedicines to help the body make more of the proteins that the motor neurons need\\nGene therapy for children under 2 years of age\\nPhysical, occupational, and rehabilitation therapy to help to improve posture and the mobility of the joints. These therapies may also improve blood flow and slow muscle weakness and atrophy. Some people may also need therapy for trouble speaking, chewing, and swallowing.\\nAssistive devices such as supports or braces, orthotics, speech synthesizers, and wheelchairs to help people stay more independent\\nGood nutrition and a balanced diet to help maintain weight and strength. Some people might need a feeding tube in order to get the nutrition they need.\\nBreathing support for people who have muscle weakness in the neck, throat, and chest. The support may include devices to help with breathing during the day and to prevent sleep apnea at night. Some people might need to be on a ventilator.\\n\\nNIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke\\n\",\n",
       " 'Hysterectomy': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nA hysterectomy is surgery to remove a woman's uterus or womb. The uterus is the place where a baby grows when a woman is pregnant.  After a hysterectomy, you no longer have menstrual periods and can't become pregnant.  Sometimes the surgery also removes the ovaries and fallopian tubes. If you have both ovaries taken out, you will enter menopause.\\nYour health care provider might recommend a hysterectomy if you have:\\nFibroids \\nEndometriosis that hasn't been cured by medicine or surgery\\nUterine prolapse -  when the uterus drops into the vagina \\nCancer of the uterine, cervix, or ovaries\\nVaginal bleeding that persists despite treatment  \\nChronic pelvic pain, as a last resort \\n\\nDept. of Health and Human Services Office on Women's Health\\n\",\n",
       " 'Angioplasty': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nWhat is angioplasty?\\nAngioplasty is a procedure to improve blood flow in coronary arteries that have become narrow or blocked. Your coronary arteries supply oxygen-rich blood to the heart. If you have coronary artery disease, a sticky material called plaque builds up in the coronary arteries. Plaque is made of cholesterol, calcium, and other substances in your blood. Over time, it can narrow your arteries or fully block them. When this happens, some parts of your heart don't get enough blood.\\nAngioplasty widens the blocked part of the artery so more blood can get through. It is also called percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).\\nWhat conditions does angioplasty treat?\\nDoctors use angioplasty to:\\n\\nReduce chest pain from blockages in the coronary arteries. This type of pain is called angina. There are different types of angina. Angioplasty treats certain types.\\nLimit damage to the heart during or right after a heart attack. In this case, angioplasty is an emergency treatment.\\n\\nAngioplasty does not cure coronary artery disease. To help prevent more plaque blockages, you'll need to take any prescribed medicines, eat healthy foods, and get regular exercise.\\nWhat happens during angioplasty?\\nMost people have angioplasties in a hospital in a special room called a cardiac catheterization, or cath, lab. You will be awake and lying down. You'll get medicine to help you relax through an intravenous (IV) line. This is a small tube that goes into a vein in your hand or arm.\\nAngioplasty is done through a blood vessel in your arm, wrist, or groin. Your doctor will:\\n\\nMake a small opening in that area to insert a thin tube (a catheter) into a blood vessel.\\nThread the tube through the vessel to your heart, using x-rays as a guide.\\nInject contrast dye inside your arteries. The dye highlights your heart and blood vessels in the x-rays.\\nReplace the first tube with another one that has a small, deflated balloon on the end.\\nGuide the balloon inside the blockage and inflate it to push the plaque flat against the artery wall. This makes the artery wider and improves blood flow.\\nSometimes put a small, mesh tube into the artery to help keep it open. The tube is called a stent. Some stents have a coating of medicine that helps prevent blood clots from forming.\\n\\nWhat happens after an angioplasty?\\nIf you had an angioplasty for chest pain, you'll go to a recovery room for a few hours. You may stay in the hospital overnight. Your doctor will probably prescribe medicines to prevent blood clots. Most people can return to their usual activities after a week.\\nIf you had an emergency angioplasty for a heart attack, you'll need to stay in the hospital for about a few more days.\\nAre there any risks from angioplasty?\\nAngioplasty is very safe. You may get a bruise, feel sore, or have some bleeding where the tubes were inserted. More serious problems don't happen very often, but they are possible. They can include serious bleeding, blood clots, and narrowing of the artery again.\\nNIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute \\n\",\n",
       " 'Fetal Health and Development': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nA normal pregnancy lasts nine months. Each three-month period of pregnancy is called a trimester. During each trimester, the fetus grows and develops. Regular medical checkups and prenatal tests are very important. They can:\\nHelp keep you and your baby healthy\\nSpot problems with your baby (if there are any). In some cases, health care professionals can treat the problem before your baby is born.  But even when they cannot, it can still be helpful to know about the problem early on. That gives you time to learn about your baby's condition and prepare for any challenges you may face after the baby is born.\\nPrevent problems during delivery. For example, if your baby is breech (bottom first or feet first, instead of head first), you may need to have a Cesarean section to avoid complications.\\n\\nBesides getting medical care, there are other things you can do to keep your baby as healthy as possible. It's important not to drink or smoke.  Try to eat a healthy diet and make sure to take care of any health problems you have during pregnancy.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Scabies': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nScabies is an itchy skin condition caused by the microscopic mite Sarcoptes scabei. It is common all over the world, and can affect anyone. Scabies spreads quickly in crowded conditions where there is frequent skin-to-skin contact between people. Hospitals, child-care centers, and nursing homes are examples. Scabies can easily infect sex partners and other household members. Sharing clothes, towels, and bedding can sometimes spread scabies.  This can happen much more easily when the infested person has crusted scabies. You cannot get scabies from a pet. Pets get a different mite infection called mange. \\nSymptoms are:\\nPimple-like irritations or a rash \\nIntense itching, especially at night\\nSores caused by scratching \\n\\nYour health care provider diagnoses scabies by looking at the skin rash and finding burrows in the skin.\\nSeveral lotions are available to treat scabies.

Treatment is also recommended for household members and sexual partners.\\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention\\n\",\n",
       " 'Brain Malformations': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nMost brain malformations begin long before a baby is born. Something damages the developing nervous system or causes it to develop abnormally. Sometimes it's a genetic problem. In other cases, exposure to certain medicines, infections, or radiation during pregnancy interferes with brain development. Parts of the brain may be missing, abnormally small or large, or not fully developed.\\nTreatment depends upon the problem. In many cases, treatment only helps with symptoms. It may include antiseizure medicines, shunts to drain fluid from the brain, and physical therapy.\\nThere are head malformations that do not involve the brain. Craniofacial disorders are the result of abnormal growth of soft tissue and bones in the face and head.

       " 'Cholera': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nCholera is a bacterial infection that causes diarrhea. The cholera bacterium is usually found in water or food that has been contaminated by feces (poop). Cholera is rare in the US. You may get it if you travel to parts of the world with poor water and sewage treatment. Outbreaks can also happen after disasters. The disease is not likely to spread directly from person to person.\\nCholera infections are often mild. Some people don't have any symptoms. If you do get symptoms, they usually start 2 to 3 days after infection. The most common symptom is watery diarrhea.\\nIn some cases, the infection can be severe, causing  lots of watery diarrhea, vomiting, and leg cramps. Because you quickly lose body fluids, you are at risk for dehydration and shock. Without treatment, you could die within hours. If you think that you might have cholera, you should get medical care right away.\\nDoctors diagnose cholera with a stool sample or rectal swab. Treatment is the replacement of the fluid and salts that you lost through the diarrhea. This is usually with a rehydration solution that you drink. People with severe cases may need an I.V. to replace the fluids. Some of them may also need antibiotics. Most people who get fluid replacement right away will recover.\\nThere are vaccines to prevent cholera. One of them is available for adults in the U.S. Very few Americans need it, because most people do not visit areas that have an active cholera outbreak.\\nThere are also simple steps you can take to help to prevent cholera infection:\\n\\nUse only bottled or purified water for drinking, washing dishes, making ice cubes, and brushing your teeth\\nIf you do use tap water, boil it or use iodine tablets\\nWash your hands often with soap and clean water\\nMake sure that the cooked food you eat is fully cooked and served hot\\nAvoid unwashed or unpeeled raw fruits and vegetables\\n\\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention\\n\",\n",

Symptoms include leaning to one side and having uneven shoulders and hips. Sometimes it is easy to notice, but not always.\\nChildren may get screening for scoliosis at school or during a checkup. If it looks like there is a problem, your doctor will use your medical and family history, a physical exam, and imaging tests to make a diagnosis. Treatment depends on your age, how much more you're likely to grow, how much curving there is, and whether the curve is temporary or permanent. People with mild scoliosis might only need checkups to see if the curve is getting worse. Others might need to wear a brace or have surgery. \\nNIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases\\n\",\n",

Your bone marrow makes the cells which will develop into white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. Each type of cell has a different job:\\nWhite blood cells help your body fight infection\\nRed blood cells deliver oxygen from your lungs to your tissues and organs\\nPlatelets help form clots to stop bleeding\\n\\nWhen you have leukemia, your bone marrow makes large numbers of abnormal cells. This problem most often happens with white blood cells. These abnormal cells build up in your bone marrow and blood. They crowd out the healthy blood cells and make it hard for your cells and blood to do their work.\\nWhat is acute myeloid leukemia (AML)?\\nAcute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a type of acute leukemia. \"Acute\" means that the leukemia usually gets worse quickly if it\\'s not treated. In AML, the bone marrow makes abnormal myeloblasts (a type of white blood cell), red blood cells, or platelets. When the abnormal cells crowd out the healthy cells, it can lead to infection, anemia, and easy bleeding. The abnormal cells can also spread outside the blood to other parts of the body.\\nThere are several different subtypes of AML. The subtypes are based on how developed the cancer cells are when you get your diagnosis and how different they are from normal cells.\\nWhat causes acute myeloid leukemia (AML)?\\nAML happens when there are changes in the genetic material (DNA) in bone marrow cells. The cause of these genetic changes is unknown. However, there are certain factors that raise your risk of AML.\\nWho is at risk for acute myeloid leukemia (AML)?\\nThe factors that raise your risk of AML include:\\nBeing male\\nSmoking, especially after age 60\\nHaving had chemotherapy or radiation therapy\\nTreatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) as a child\\nExposure to the chemical benzene\\nA history of another blood disorder such as myelodysplastic syndrome\\n\\nWhat are the symptoms of acute myeloid leukemia (AML)?\\nThe signs and symptoms of AML include:\\nFever\\nShortness of breath\\nEasy bruising or bleeding\\nPetechiae, which are tiny red dots under the skin. They are caused by bleeding.\\nWeakness or feeling tired\\nWeight loss or loss of appetite\\nBone or joint pain, if the abnormal cells build up near or inside the bones\\n\\nHow is acute myeloid leukemia (AML) diagnosed?\\nYour health care provider may use many tools to diagnose AML and figure out which subtype you have:\\nA physical exam\\nA medical history\\nBlood tests, such as a complete blood count (CBC) and blood smear\\nBone marrow tests. There are two main types - bone marrow aspiration and bone marrow biopsy. Both tests involve removing a sample of bone marrow and bone. The samples are sent to a lab for testing.\\nGenetic tests to look for gene and chromosome changes\\n\\nIf you are diagnosed with AML, you may have additional tests to see whether the cancer has spread. These include imaging tests and a lumbar puncture, which is a procedure to collect and test cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).\\nWhat are the treatments for acute myeloid leukemia (AML)?\\nTreatments for AML include:\\nChemotherapy\\nRadiation therapy\\nChemotherapy with stem cell transplant\\nOther anticancer medicines\\n\\nWhich treatment you get often depends on which subtype of AML you have.\\nTreatment is usually done in two phases:\\nThe goal of the first phase is to kill the leukemia cells in the blood and bone marrow. This puts the leukemia into remission. Remission means that the signs and symptoms of cancer are reduced or have disappeared.\\nThe second phase is known as post-remission therapy. Its goal is to prevent a relapse (return) of the cancer. It involves killing any remaining leukemia cells that may not be active but could begin to regrow.\\n\\nNIH: National Cancer Institute\\n',\n",
       " 'Oral Cancer': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nOral cancer can form in any part of the mouth. Most oral cancers begin in the flat cells that cover the surfaces of your mouth, tongue, and lips.

Some women have more than one cause of pelvic pain at the same time.\\nYou might have to have lab, imaging, or other medical tests to find the cause of the pain. The treatment will depend on the cause, how bad the pain is, and how often it occurs.\\nNIH: National Institute of Child Health and Human Development\\n\",\n",
       " 'Carbohydrates': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nWhat are carbohydrates?\\nCarbohydrates, or carbs, are sugar molecules. Along with proteins and fats, carbohydrates are one of three main nutrients found in foods and drinks.\\nYour body breaks down carbohydrates into glucose. Glucose, or blood sugar, is the main source of energy for your body's cells, tissues, and organs. Glucose can be used immediately or stored in the liver and muscles for later use.\\nWhat are the different types of carbohydrates?\\nThere are three main types of carbohydrates:\\nSugars. They are also called simple carbohydrates because they are in the most basic form. They can be added to foods, such as the sugar in candy, desserts, processed foods, and regular soda. They also include the kinds of sugar that are found naturally in fruits, vegetables, and milk.\\nStarches. They are complex carbohydrates, which are made of lots of simple sugars strung together. Your body needs to break starches down into sugars to use them for energy. Starches include bread, cereal, and pasta. They also include certain vegetables, like potatoes, peas, and corn.\\nFiber. It is also a complex carbohydrate. Your body cannot break down most fibers, so eating foods with fiber can help you feel full and make you less likely to overeat. Diets high in fiber have other health benefits. They may help prevent stomach or intestinal problems, such as constipation. They may also help lower cholesterol and blood sugar. Fiber is found in many foods that come from plants, including fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, beans, and whole grains.\\n\\nWhich foods have carbohydrates?\\nCommon foods with carbohydrates include:\\nGrains, such as bread, noodles, pasta, crackers, cereals, and rice\\nFruits, such as apples, bananas, berries, mangoes, melons, and oranges\\nDairy products, such as milk and yogurt\\nLegumes, including dried beans, lentils, and peas\\nSnack foods and sweets, such as cakes, cookies, candy, and other desserts\\nJuices, regular sodas, fruit drinks, sports drinks, and energy drinks that contain sugar\\nStarchy vegetables, such as potatoes, corn, and peas\\n\\nSome foods don't have a lot of carbohydrates, such as meat, fish, poultry, some types of cheese, nuts, and oils.\\nWhich types of carbohydrates should I eat?\\nYou do need to eat some carbohydrates to give your body energy. But it's important to eat the right kinds of carbohydrates for your health:\\nWhen eating grains, choose mostly whole grains and not refined grains:\\n\\t\\nWhole grains are foods like whole wheat bread, brown rice, whole cornmeal, and oatmeal. They offer lots of nutrients that your body needs, like vitamins, minerals, and fiber. To figure out whether a product has a lot of whole grain, check the ingredients list on the package and see if a whole grain is one of the first few items listed.\\nRefined grains are foods that have had some parts of the grains removed. This also removes some of the nutrients that are good for your health.\\n\\n\\nEat foods with lots of fiber. The Nutrition Facts labels on the back of food packages tells you how much fiber a product has.\\nTry to avoid foods that have a lot of added sugar. These foods can have many calories but not much nutrition. Eating too much added sugar raises your blood sugar and can make you gain weight. You can tell if a food or drink has added sugars by looking at the Nutrition Facts label on the back of the food package. It tells you how much total sugar and added sugar is in that food or drink.\\n\\nHow many carbohydrates should I eat?\\nThere is no one-size-fits-all amount of carbohydrates that people should eat. This amount can vary, depending on factors such as your age, sex, health, and whether or not you are trying to lose or gain weight. On average, people should get 45 to 65% of their calories from carbohydrates every day. On the Nutrition Facts labels, the Daily Value for total carbohydrates is 275 g per day. This is based on a 2,000-calorie daily diet. Your Daily Value may be higher or lower depending on your calorie needs and health.\\nIs it safe to eat a low-carb diet?\\nSome people go on a low-carb diet to try to lose weight. This usually means eating between 25 g and 150 g of carbs each day. This kind of diet can be safe, but you should talk to your health care provider before starting it. One problem with low-carb diets is that they can limit the amount of fiber you get each day. They can also be hard to stay on for the long term.\\n\",\n",

       " 'Ureteral Disorders': '\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nYour kidneys make urine by filtering wastes and extra water from your blood.  The urine travels from the kidneys to the bladder in two thin tubes called ureters.\\nThe ureters are about 8 to 10 inches long. Muscles in the ureter walls tighten and relax to force urine down and away from the kidneys. Small amounts of urine flow from the ureters into the bladder about every 10 to 15 seconds.\\nSometimes the ureters can become blocked or injured. This can block the flow of urine to the bladder. If urine stands still or backs up the ureter, you may get a urinary tract infections.\\nDoctors diagnose problems with the ureters using different tests. These include urine tests, x-rays, and examination of the ureter with a scope called a cystoscope. Treatment depends on the cause of the problem.

       " 'Benign Tumors': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nTumors are abnormal growths in your body. They can be either benign or malignant. Benign tumors aren't cancer. Malignant ones are. Benign tumors grow only in one place. They cannot spread or invade other parts of your body. Even so, they can be dangerous if they press on vital organs, such as your brain.\\nTumors are made up of extra cells. Normally, cells grow and divide to form new cells as your body needs them. When cells grow old, they die, and new cells take their place. Sometimes, this process goes wrong. New cells form when your body does not need them, and old cells do not die when they should. These extra cells can divide without stopping and may form tumor.\\nTreatment often involves surgery. Benign tumors usually don't grow back.\\nNIH: National Cancer Institute\\n\",\n",

Suddenly, a sharp, piercing pain shoots through the wrist and up your arm. Just a passing cramp? It could be carpal tunnel syndrome.\\nThe carpal tunnel is a narrow passageway of ligament and bones at the base of your hand. It contains nerve and tendons. Sometimes, thickening from irritated tendons or other swelling narrows the tunnel and causes the nerve to be compressed. Symptoms usually start gradually.

Other causes include performing assembly line work, wrist injury, or swelling due to certain diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis. Women are three times more likely to have carpal tunnel syndrome than men.\\nEarly diagnosis and treatment are important to prevent permanent nerve damage. Your doctor diagnoses carpal tunnel syndrome with a physical exam and special nerve tests.  Treatment includes resting your hand, splints, pain and anti-inflammatory medicines, and sometimes surgery. \\nNIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke\\n\",\n",

       " 'Animal Diseases and Your Health': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nAnimal diseases that people can catch are called zoonoses.   Many diseases affecting humans can be traced to animals or animal products. You can get a disease directly from an animal, or indirectly, through the environment.\\nFarm animals can carry diseases. If you touch them or things they have touched, like fencing or buckets, wash your hands thoroughly. Adults should make sure children who visit farms or petting zoos wash up as well. \\nThough they may be cute and cuddly, wild animals may carry germs, viruses, and parasites. Deer and deer mice carry ticks that cause Lyme disease. Some wild animals may carry rabies. Enjoy wildlife from a distance.\\nPets can also make you sick. Reptiles pose a particular risk. Turtles, snakes and iguanas can transmit Salmonella bacteria to their owners. You can get rabies from an infected dog or toxoplasmosis from handling kitty litter of an infected cat. The chance that your dog or cat will make you sick is small. You can reduce the risk by practicing good hygiene, keeping pet areas clean and keeping your pets' shots up-to-date. \\n\",\n",

       " 'Reflux in Children': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nWhat are reflux (GER) and GERD?\\nThe esophagus is the tube that carries food from your mouth to your stomach. If your child has reflux, his or her stomach contents come back up into the esophagus. Another name for reflux is gastroesophageal reflux (GER).\\nGERD stands for gastroesophageal reflux disease. It is a more serious and long-lasting type of reflux. If your child has reflux more than twice a week for a few weeks, it could be GERD.\\nWhat causes reflux and GERD in children?\\nThere is a muscle (the lower esophageal sphincter) that acts as a valve between the esophagus and stomach. When your child swallows, this muscle relaxes to let food pass from the esophagus to the stomach. This muscle normally stays closed, so the stomach contents don't flow back into the esophagus.\\nIn children who have reflux and GERD, this muscle becomes weak or relaxes when it shouldn't, and the stomach contents flow back into the esophagus. This can happen because of:\\nA hiatal hernia, a condition in which the upper part of your stomach pushes upward into your chest through an opening in your diaphragm\\nIncreased pressure on the abdomen from being overweight or having obesity\\nMedicines, such as certain asthma medicines, antihistamines (which treat allergies), pain relievers, sedatives (which help put people to sleep), and antidepressants\\nSmoking or exposure to secondhand smoke\\nA previous surgery on the esophagus or upper abdomen\\nA severe developmental delay\\nCertain neurological conditions, such as cerebral palsy\\n\\nHow common are reflux and GERD in children?\\nMany children have occasional reflux. GERD is not as common; up to 25% of children have symptoms of GERD. \\nWhat are the symptoms of reflux and GERD in children?\\nYour child might not even notice reflux. But some children taste food or stomach acid at the back of the mouth. \\nIn children, GERD can cause:\\nHeartburn, a painful, burning feeling in the middle of the chest. It is more common in older children (12 years and up).\\nBad breath\\nNausea and vomiting\\nProblems swallowing or painful swallowing\\nBreathing problems\\nThe wearing away of teeth\\n\\nHow do doctors diagnose reflux and GERD in children?\\nIn most cases, a doctor diagnoses reflux by reviewing your child's symptoms and medical history. If the symptoms do not get better with lifestyle changes and anti-reflux medicines, your child may need testing to check for GERD or other problems.\\nSeveral tests can help a doctor diagnose GERD. Sometimes doctors order more than one test to get a diagnosis. Commonly-used tests include:\\nUpper GI series, which looks at the shape of your child's upper GI (gastrointestinal) tract. You child will drink a contrast liquid called barium. For young children, the barium is mixed in with a bottle or other food. The health care professional will take several x-rays of your child to track the barium as it goes through the esophagus and stomach.\\nEsophageal pH and impedance monitoring, which measures the amount of acid or liquid in your child's esophagus. A doctor or nurse places a thin flexible tube through your child's nose into the stomach. The end of the tube in the esophagus measures when and how much acid comes back up into the esophagus. The other end of the tube attaches to a monitor that records the measurements. Your child will wear the tube for 24 hours. He or she may need to stay in the hospital during the test.\\nUpper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy and biopsy, which uses an endoscope, a long, flexible tube with a light and camera at the end of it. The doctor runs the endoscope down your child's esophagus, stomach, and first part of the small intestine. While looking at the pictures from the endoscope, the doctor may also take tissue samples (biopsy).\\n\\nWhat lifestyle changes can help treat my child's reflux or GERD?\\nSometimes reflux and GERD in children can be treated with lifestyle changes:\\nLosing weight, if needed\\nEating smaller meals\\nAvoiding high-fat foods\\nWearing loose-fitting clothing around the abdomen\\nStaying upright for 3 hours after meals and not reclining and slouching when sitting\\nSleeping at a slight angle. Raise the head of your child's bed 6 to 8 inches by safely putting blocks under the bedposts.\\n\\nWhat treatments might the doctor give for my child's GERD?\\nIf changes at home do not help enough, the doctor may recommend medicines to treat GERD. The medicines work by lowering the amount of acid in your child's stomach.\\nSome medicines for GERD in children are over-the-counter, and some are prescription medicines. They include:\\nOver-the-counter antacids\\nH2 blockers, which decrease acid production\\nProton pump inhibitors (PPIs), which lower the amount of acid the stomach makes\\nProkinetics, which help the stomach empty faster\\n\\nIf these don't help and your child still has severe symptoms, then surgery might be an option. A pediatric gastroenterologist, a doctor who treats children who have digestive diseases, would do the surgery.\\nNIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases\\n\",\n",
       " 'Phenylketonuria': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nPhenylketonuria (PKU) is a type of amino acid metabolism disorder. It is inherited. If you have it, your body can't process phenylalanine (Phe). Phe is an amino acid, a building block of proteins. It is in almost all foods. If your Phe level gets too high, it can damage your brain and cause severe intellectual disability.  All babies born in U.S. hospitals must now have a screening test for PKU. This makes it easier to diagnose and treat the problem early. \\nThe best treatment for PKU is a diet of low-protein foods. There are special formulas for newborns.  For older children and adults, the diet includes many fruits and vegetables. It also includes some low-protein breads, pastas, and cereals. Nutritional formulas provide the vitamins and minerals you can't get from their food.\\nBabies who get on this special diet soon after they are born develop normally. Many have no symptoms of PKU. It is important to stay on the diet for the rest of your life.\\nNIH: National Institute of Child Health and Human Development\\n\",\n",
       " 'Dementia': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nWhat is dementia?\\nDementia is a loss of mental functions that is severe enough to affect your daily life and activities. These functions include:\\nMemory\\nLanguage skills\\nVisual perception (your ability to make sense of what you see)\\nProblem solving\\nTrouble with everyday tasks\\nThe ability to focus and pay attention\\n\\nIt is normal to become a bit more forgetful as you age. But dementia is not a normal part of aging. It is a serious disorder which interferes with your daily life.\\nWhat are the types of dementia?\\nThe most common types of dementia are known as neurodegenerative disorders. These are diseases in which the cells of the brain stop working or die. They include:\\nAlzheimer's disease, which is the most common form of dementia among older people. People with Alzheimer's have plaques and tangles in their brain. These are abnormal buildups of different proteins. Beta-amyloid protein clumps up and forms plaques in between your brain cells. Tau protein builds up and forms tangles inside the nerve cells of your brain. There is also a loss of connection between nerve cells in the brain.\\nLewy body dementia, which causes movement symptoms along with dementia. Lewy bodies are abnormal deposits of a protein in the brain.\\nFrontotemporal disorders, which cause changes to certain parts of the brain:\\n\\t\\nChanges in the frontal lobe lead to behavioral symptoms\\nChanges in the temporal lobe lead to language and emotional disorders\\n\\n\\nVascular dementia, which involves changes to the brain's blood supply. It is often caused by a stroke or atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries) in the brain.\\nMixed dementia, which is a combination of two or more types of dementia. For example, some people have both Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia.\\n\\nOther conditions can cause dementia or dementia-like symptoms, including:\\nCreutzfeldt-Jakob disease, a rare brain disorder\\nHuntington's disease, an inherited, progressive brain disease\\nChronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), caused by repeated traumatic brain injury\\nHIV-associated dementia (HAD)\\n\\nWho is at risk for dementia?\\nCertain factors can raise your risk for developing dementia, including:\\nAging. This is the biggest risk factor for dementia.\\nSmoking\\nUncontrolled diabetes\\nHigh blood pressure\\nDrinking too much alcohol\\nHaving close family members who have dementia\\n\\nWhat are the symptoms of dementia?\\nThe symptoms of dementia can vary, depending on which parts of the brain are affected. Often, forgetfulness is the first symptom.  Dementia also causes problems with the ability to think, problem solve, and reason. For example, people with dementia may:\\nGet lost in a familiar neighborhood\\nUse unusual words to refer to familiar objects\\nForget the name of a close family member or friend\\nForget old memories\\nNeed help doing tasks that they used to do by themselves\\n\\nSome people with dementia cannot control their emotions and their personalities may change. They may become apathetic, meaning that they are no longer interested in normal daily activities or events. They may lose their inhibitions and stop caring about other peoples' feelings.\\nCertain types of dementia can also cause problems with balance and movement.\\nThe stages of dementia range from mild to severe. In the mildest stage, it is just beginning to affect a person's functioning. In the most severe stage, the person is completely dependent on others for care.\\nHow is dementia diagnosed?\\nYour health care provider may use many tools to make a diagnosis:\\nA medical history, which includes asking about your symptoms\\nA physical exam\\nTests of your thinking, memory, and language abilities\\nOther tests, such as blood tests, genetic tests, and brain scans\\nA mental health evaluation to see whether a mental disorder is contributing to your symptoms\\n\\nWhat are the treatments for dementia?\\nThere is no cure for most types of dementia, including Alzheimer's disease and Lewy body dementia. Treatments may help to maintain mental function longer, manage behavioral symptoms, and slow down the symptoms of disease. They may include:\\nMedicines may temporarily improve memory and thinking or slow down their decline. They only work in some people. Other medicines can treat symptoms such as anxiety, depression, sleep problems, and muscle stiffness. Some of these medicines can cause strong side effects in people with dementia. It is important to talk to your health care provider about which medicines will be safe for you.\\nOccupational therapy to help find ways to more easily do everyday activities\\nSpeech therapy to help with swallowing difficulties and trouble speaking loudly and clearly\\nMental health counseling to help people with dementia and their families learn how to manage difficult emotions and behaviors. It can also help them plan for the future.\\nMusic or art therapy to reduce anxiety and improve well-being\\n\\nCan dementia be prevented?\\nResearchers have not found a proven way to prevent dementia. Living a healthy lifestyle might influence some of your risk factors for dementia.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Hemochromatosis': '\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nHemochromatosis is a disease in which too much iron builds up in your body. Your body needs iron but too much of it is toxic. If you have hemochromatosis, you absorb more iron than you need. Your body has no natural way to get rid of the extra iron. It stores it in body tissues, especially the liver, heart, and pancreas. The extra iron can damage your organs. Without treatment, it can cause your organs to fail.\\nThere are two types of hemochromatosis. Primary hemochromatosis is an inherited disease. Secondary hemochromatosis is usually the result of something else, such as anemia, thalassemia, liver disease, or blood transfusions.\\nMany symptoms of hemochromatosis are similar to those of other diseases. Not everyone has symptoms. If you do, you may have joint pain, fatigue, general weakness, weight loss, and stomach pain.\\nYour doctor will diagnose hemochromatosis based on your medical and family histories, a physical exam, and the results from tests and procedures. Treatments include removing blood (and iron) from your body, medicines, and changes in your diet.\\nNIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute\\n',\n",

This is especially true of the prefrontal cortex, which is used to make decisions. Taking drugs when young can interfere with developmental processes occurring in the brain. It can also affect their decision-making. They may be more likely to do risky things, such as unsafe sex and dangerous driving.\\nThe earlier young people start using drugs, the greater their chances of continuing to use them and become addicted later in life.Taking drugs when you are young can contribute to the development of adult health problems, such as heart disease, high blood pressure, and sleep disorders.\\nWhich drugs most commonly used by young people?\\nThe drugs that are most commonly used by young people are alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana. Recently, more young people have started vaping tobacco and marijuana. There is still a lot we don't know about the dangers of vaping. Some people have unexpectedly gotten very ill or have even died after vaping. Because of this, young people should stay away from vaping.\\nWhy do young people take drugs?\\nThere are many different reasons why a young person may take drugs, including:\\nTo fit in. Young people may do drugs because they want to be accepted by friends or peers who are doing drugs.\\nTo feel good. Abused drugs can produce feelings of pleasure.\\nTo feel better. Some young people suffer from depression, anxiety, stress-related disorders, and physical pain. They may do drugs to try to get some relief.\\nTo do better in academics or sports.

For example, some pain relievers, cold medicines, and over-the-counter medicines for alertness contain synthetic caffeine. So do energy drinks and \"energy-boosting\" gums and snacks.\\nMost people consume caffeine from drinks. The amount of caffeine in different drinks can vary a lot, but it is generally:\\nAn 8-ounce cup of coffee: 95-200 mg\\nA 12-ounce can of cola: 35-45 mg\\nAn 8-ounce energy drink: 70-100 mg\\nAn 8-ounce cup of tea: 14-60 mg\\n\\nWhat are caffeine\\'s effects on the body?\\nCaffeine has many effects on your body\\'s metabolism. It:\\nStimulates your central nervous system, which can make you feel more awake and give you a boost of energy\\nIs a diuretic, meaning that it helps your body get rid of extra salt and water by urinating more\\nIncreases the release of acid in your stomach, sometimes leading to an upset stomach or heartburn\\nMay interfere with the absorption of calcium in the body\\nIncreases your blood pressure\\n\\nWithin one hour of eating or drinking caffeine, it reaches its peak level in your blood. You may continue to feel the effects of caffeine for four to six hours.\\nWhat are the side effects from too much caffeine?\\nFor most people, it is not harmful to consume up to 400mg of caffeine a day. If you do eat or drink too much caffeine, it can cause health problems, such as:\\nRestlessness and shakiness\\nInsomnia\\nHeadaches\\nDizziness\\nFast heart rate\\nDehydration\\nAnxiety\\nDependency, so you need to take more of it to get the same results\\n\\nSome people are more sensitive to the effects of caffeine than others.\\nWhat are energy drinks, and why can they be a problem?\\nEnergy drinks are beverages that have added caffeine. The amount of caffeine in energy drinks can vary widely, and sometimes the labels on the drinks do not give you the actual amount of caffeine in them. Energy drinks may also contain sugars, vitamins, herbs, and supplements.\\nCompanies that make energy drinks claim that the drinks can increase alertness and improve physical and mental performance. This has helped make the drinks popular with American teens and young adults. There\\'s limited data showing that energy drinks might temporarily improve alertness and physical endurance. There is not enough evidence to show that they enhance strength or power. But what we do know is that energy drinks can be dangerous because they have large amounts of caffeine. And since they have lots of sugar, they can contribute to weight gain and worsen diabetes.\\nSometimes young people mix their energy drinks with alcohol. It is dangerous to combine alcohol and caffeine. Caffeine can interfere with your ability to recognize how drunk you are, which can lead you to drink more. This also makes you more likely to make bad decisions.\\nWho should avoid or limit caffeine?\\nYou should check with your health care provider about whether you should limit or avoid caffeine if you:\\nAre pregnant, since caffeine passes through the placenta to your baby.\\nAre breastfeeding, since a small amount of caffeine that you consume is passed along to your baby.\\nHave sleep disorders, including insomnia.\\nHave migraines or other chronic headaches.\\nHave anxiety.\\nHave GERD or ulcers.\\nHave arrhythmia (a problem with the rate or rhythm of your heartbeat).\\nHave high blood pressure.\\nTake certain medicines or supplements, including stimulants, certain antibiotics, asthma medicines, and heart medicines. Check with your health care provider about whether there might be interactions between caffeine and any medicines and supplements that you take.\\nAre a child or teen. Neither should have as much caffeine as adults. Children can be especially sensitive to the effects of caffeine.\\n\\nWhat is caffeine withdrawal?\\nIf you have been consuming caffeine on a regular basis and then suddenly stop, you may have caffeine withdrawal. Symptoms can include:\\nHeadaches\\nDrowsiness\\nIrritability\\nNausea\\nTrouble concentrating\\n\\nThese symptoms usually go away after a couple of days.\\n',\n",

They give you a way to tell your wishes to family, friends, and health care professionals and to avoid confusion later on. \\nA living will tells which treatments you want if you are dying or permanently unconscious. You can accept or refuse medical care. You might want to include instructions on:\\nThe use of dialysis and breathing machines\\n\\tIf you want to be resuscitated if your breathing or heartbeat stops \\n\\tTube feeding\\n\\tOrgan or tissue donation \\n\\n\\nA durable power of attorney for health care is a document that names your health care proxy. Your proxy is someone you trust to make health decisions for you if you are unable to do so. \\nNIH: National Cancer Institute\\n',\n",
       " 'Usher Syndrome': '\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nUsher syndrome is an inherited disease that causes serious hearing loss and retinitis pigmentosa, an eye disorder that causes your vision to get worse over time. It is the most common condition that affects both hearing and vision.\\nThere are three types of Usher syndrome:\\n\\nPeople with type I are deaf from birth and have severe balance problems from a young age. Vision problems usually start by age 10 and lead to blindness.\\nPeople with type II have moderate to severe hearing loss and normal balance. Vision problems start in the early teens and get worse more slowly than in type I.\\nPeople with type III are born with normal hearing and near-normal balance but develop vision problems and then hearing loss.\\n\\nThere is no cure. Tools such as hearing aids or cochlear implants can help some people. Training such as Braille instruction, low-vision services, or auditory training can also help.\\nNIH: National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders\\n',\n",
       " 'Drowning': '\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nPeople drown when they get too much water in their lungs. You can drown in as little as an inch or two of water. Babies can drown in a sink or bathtub. Preschoolers are most likely to drown in a swimming pool. People who have seizure disorders are also at risk in the water. Drowning can happen quickly and silently. \\nDrowning precautions should include:\\n\\tFences around pools\\n\\tSupervising children near any body of water, including tubs\\n\\tNot swimming or boating when under the influence of alcohol or sedatives\\n\\tWearing life jackets when boating\\n\\tLearning CPR\\n\\n',\n",
       " 'Urine and Urination': '\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nYour kidneys make urine by filtering wastes and extra water from your blood. The waste is called urea. Your blood carries it to the kidneys. From the kidneys, urine travels down two thin tubes called ureters to the bladder. The bladder stores urine until you are ready to urinate. It swells into a round shape when it is full and gets smaller when empty. If your urinary system is healthy, your bladder can hold up to 16 ounces (2 cups) of urine comfortably for 2 to 5 hours.\\nYou may have problems with urination if you have:\\nKidney failure\\nUrinary tract infections \\nAn enlarged prostate\\nBladder control problems like  incontinence, overactive bladder, or interstitial cystitis\\nA blockage that prevents you from emptying your bladder \\n\\nSome conditions may also cause you to have blood or protein in your urine. If you have a urinary problem, see your health care provider. Urinalysis and other urine tests can help to diagnose the problem. Treatment depends on the cause.\\nNIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases\\n',\n",
       " 'Exercise for Children': '\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nLike adults, kids need exercise. Most children need at least an hour of physical activity every day. Regular exercise has many benefits for children. It can help them:\\nFeel less stressed\\nFeel better about themselves\\nFeel more ready to learn in school\\nKeep a healthy weight\\nBuild and keep healthy bones, muscles and joints\\nSleep better at night\\n\\nAs kids spend more time watching TV, they spend less time running and playing. Parents should limit TV, video game and computer time.  Parents can set a good example by being active themselves.  Exercising together can be fun for everyone.  Competitive sports can help kids stay fit. Walking or biking to school, dancing, bowling and yoga are some other ways for kids to get exercise.\\n',\n",
       " 'Financial Assistance': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\n\\nHealth care can be costly. If you have health insurance, it usually pays at least part of your medical costs. If you don't have insurance or need help with costs that aren't covered, financial assistance might \\nbe available. Certain government programs and nonprofit organizations can help. You can also discuss \\nconcerns about paying your medical bills with your health care provider, social worker or the business \\noffice of your clinic or hospital.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " 'Norovirus Infections': '\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nNoroviruses are a group of related viruses. Infection with these viruses causes an illness called gastroenteritis, an inflammation of the stomach and intestines.  It can spread from person to person, or through contaminated food or water.  You can also get it if you touch a contaminated surface. Norovirus can be serious, especially for young children and older adults.\\nThe most common symptoms of norovirus infection are:\\nDiarrhea\\nNausea and vomiting\\nStomach pain\\n\\nOther symptoms may include fever, headache or body aches.\\nTreatment includes bed rest and lots of liquids to prevent dehydration.

       " 'Liver Transplantation': '\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nYour liver is the largest organ inside your body. It helps your body digest food, store energy, and remove poisons. You cannot live without a liver that works. If your liver fails, your doctor may put you on a waiting list for a liver transplant. Doctors do liver transplants when other treatment cannot keep a damaged liver working.\\nDuring a liver transplantation, the surgeon removes the diseased liver and replaces it with a healthy one. Most transplant livers come from a donor who has died.  Sometimes there is a living donor.  This is when a healthy person donates part of his or her liver for a specific patient.\\nThe most common reason for a transplant in adults is cirrhosis. This is scarring of the liver, caused by injury or long-term disease. The most common reason in children is biliary atresia, a disease of the bile ducts.\\nIf you have a transplant, you must take drugs the rest of your life to help keep your body from rejecting the new liver.\\nNIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases\\n',\n",
       " 'Trigeminal Neuralgia': '\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nTrigeminal neuralgia (TN) is a type of chronic pain that affects your face. It causes extreme, sudden burning or shock-like pain. It usually affects one side of the face. Any vibration on your face, even from talking, can set it off. The condition may come and go, disappearing for days or even months. But the longer you have it, the less often it goes away.\\nTN usually affects people over 50, especially women. The cause is probably a blood vessel pressing on the trigeminal nerve, one of the largest nerves in the head. Tumors and multiple sclerosis can also cause TN, but in some cases the cause is unknown.\\nThere is no specific test for TN. It can be hard to diagnose, since many other conditions can cause facial pain. Treatment options include medicines, surgery, and complementary techniques.\\nNIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke\\n',\n",
       " 'Salivary Gland Disorders': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nYour salivary glands are in your mouth. You have three pairs of major salivary glands and hundreds of small (minor) glands. They make saliva (spit) and empty it into your mouth through openings called ducts. Saliva makes your food moist, which helps you chew and swallow. It helps you digest your food. It also cleans your mouth and contains antibodies that can kill germs. \\nProblems with salivary glands can cause them to become irritated and swollen. You may have symptoms such as:\\nA bad taste in your mouth\\nDifficulty opening your mouth \\nDry mouth\\nPain in your face or mouth\\nSwelling of your face or neck\\n\\nCauses of salivary gland problems include infections, obstruction, or cancer.

       " 'Cholesterol': '\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nWhat is cholesterol?\\nCholesterol is a waxy, fat-like substance that\\'s found in all the cells in your body. Your body needs some cholesterol to make hormones, vitamin D, and substances that help you digest foods. Your body makes all the cholesterol it needs. Cholesterol is also found in foods from animal sources, such as egg yolks, meat, and cheese.\\nIf you have too much cholesterol in your blood, it can combine with other substances in the blood to form plaque. Plaque sticks to the walls of your arteries. This buildup of plaque is known as atherosclerosis. It can lead to coronary artery disease, where your coronary arteries become narrow or even blocked.\\nWhat are HDL, LDL, and VLDL?\\nHDL, LDL, and VLDL are lipoproteins. They are a combination of fat (lipid) and protein. The lipids need to be attached to the proteins so they can move through the blood. Different types of lipoproteins have different purposes:\\nHDL stands for high-density lipoprotein. It is sometimes called \"good\" cholesterol because it carries cholesterol from other parts of your body back to your liver. Your liver then removes the cholesterol from your body.\\nLDL stands for low-density lipoprotein. It is sometimes called \"bad\" cholesterol because a high LDL level leads to the buildup of plaque in your arteries.\\nVLDL stands for very low-density lipoprotein. Some people also call VLDL a \"bad\" cholesterol because it too contributes to the buildup of plaque in your arteries. But VLDL and LDL are different; VLDL mainly carries triglycerides and LDL mainly carries cholesterol.\\n\\nWhat causes high cholesterol?\\nThe most common cause of high cholesterol is an unhealthy lifestyle. This can include:\\nUnhealthy eating habits, such as eating lots of bad fats. One type, saturated fat, is found in some meats, dairy products, chocolate, baked goods, and deep-fried and processed foods. Another type, trans fat, is in some fried and processed foods. Eating these fats can raise your LDL (bad) cholesterol.\\nLack of physical activity, with lots of sitting and little exercise. This lowers your HDL (good) cholesterol.\\nSmoking, which lowers HDL cholesterol, especially in women. It also raises your LDL cholesterol.\\n\\nGenetics may also cause people to have high cholesterol. For example, familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is an inherited form of high cholesterol. Other medical conditions and certain medicines may also cause high cholesterol.\\nWhat can raise my risk of high cholesterol?\\nA variety of things can raise your risk for high cholesterol:\\nAge. Your cholesterol levels tend to rise as you get older. Even though it is less common, younger people, including children and teens, can also have high cholesterol.\\nHeredity. High blood cholesterol can run in families.\\nWeight. Being overweight or having obesity raises your cholesterol level.\\nRace. Certain races may have an increased risk of high cholesterol. For example, African Americans typically have higher HDL and LDL cholesterol levels than whites.\\n\\nWhat health problems can high cholesterol cause?\\nIf you have large deposits of plaque in your arteries, an area of plaque can rupture (break open). This can cause a blood clot to form on the surface of the plaque. If the clot becomes large enough, it can mostly or completely block blood flow in a coronary artery.\\nIf the flow of oxygen-rich blood to your heart muscle is reduced or blocked, it can cause angina (chest pain) or a heart attack.\\nPlaque also can build up in other arteries in your body, including the arteries that bring oxygen-rich blood to your brain and limbs. This can lead to problems such as carotid artery disease, stroke, and peripheral arterial disease.\\nHow is high cholesterol diagnosed?\\nThere are usually no signs or symptoms that you have high cholesterol. There is a blood test to measure your cholesterol level. When and how often you should get this test depends on your age, risk factors, and family history.  The general recommendations are:\\nFor people who are age 19 or younger::\\nThe first test should be between ages 9 to 11\\nChildren should have the test again every 5 years\\nSome children may have this test starting at age 2 if there is a family history of high blood cholesterol, heart attack, or stroke\\n\\nFor people who are age 20 or older::\\nYounger adults should have the test every 5 years\\nMen ages 45 to 65 and women ages 55 to 65 should have it every 1 to 2 years\\n\\nHow can I lower my cholesterol?\\nYou can lower your cholesterol through heart-healthy lifestyle changes. They include a heart-healthy eating plan, weight management, and regular physical activity.\\nIf the lifestyle changes alone do not lower your cholesterol enough, you may also need to take medicines. There are several types of cholesterol-lowering drugs available, including statins. If you take medicines to lower your cholesterol, you still should continue with the lifestyle changes.\\nSome people with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) may receive a treatment called lipoprotein apheresis. This treatment uses a filtering machine to remove LDL cholesterol from the blood. Then the machine returns the rest of the blood back to the person.\\nNIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute\\n',\n",
       " 'Anabolic Steroids': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nWhat are anabolic steroids?\\nAnabolic steroids are synthetic (man-made) versions of testosterone. Testosterone is the main sex hormone in men. It is needed to develop and maintain male sex characteristics, such as facial hair, deep voice, and muscle growth. Women do have some testosterone in their bodies, but in much smaller amounts.\\nWhat are anabolic steroids used for?\\nHealth care providers use anabolic steroids to treat some hormone problems in men, delayed puberty, and muscle loss from some diseases. But some people misuse anabolic steroids.\\nWhy do people misuse anabolic steroids?\\nSome bodybuilders and athletes use anabolic steroids to build muscles and improve athletic performance. They may take the steroids orally, inject them into muscles, or apply them to the skin as a gel or cream. These doses may be 10 to 100 times higher than doses used to treat medical conditions. Using them this way, without a prescription from a health care provider, is not legal or safe.\\nWhat are the health effects of misusing anabolic steroids?\\nMisuse of anabolic steroids, especially over a long period of time, has been linked to many health problems, including:\\nAcne\\nStunted growth in teens\\nHigh blood pressure\\nChanges in cholesterol\\nHeart problems, including heart attack\\nLiver disease, including cancer\\nKidney damage\\nAggressive behavior\\n\\nIn men, it can also cause:\\nBaldness\\nBreast growth\\nLow sperm count/infertility\\nShrinking of the testicles\\n\\nIn women, it can also cause:\\nChanges in your menstrual cycle (period)\\nGrowth of body and facial hair\\nMale-pattern baldness\\nVoice deepening\\n\\nAre anabolic steroids addictive?\\nEven though they don't cause a high, anabolic steroids can be addictive. You can have withdrawal symptoms if you stop using them, including:\\nFatigue\\nRestlessness\\nLoss of appetite\\nSleep problems\\nDecreased sex drive\\nSteroid cravings\\nDepression, which can sometimes be serious and even lead to suicide attempts\\n\\nBehavioral therapy and medicines can be helpful in treating anabolic steroid addiction.\\nNIH: National Institute on Drug Abuse\\n\",\n",
       " 'Pneumonia': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nWhat is pneumonia?\\nPneumonia is an infection in one or both of the lungs. It causes the air sacs of the lungs to fill up with fluid or pus. It can range from mild to severe, depending on the type of germ causing the infection, your age, and your overall health.\\nWhat causes pneumonia?\\nBacterial, viral, and fungal infections can cause pneumonia.\\nBacteria are the most common cause. Bacterial pneumonia can occur on its own. It can also develop after you've had certain viral infections such as a cold or the flu. Several different types of bacteria can cause pneumonia, including:\\nStreptococcus pneumoniae\\nLegionella pneumophila; this pneumonia is often called Legionnaires' disease\\nMycoplasma pneumoniae\\nChlamydia pneumoniae\\nHaemophilus influenzae\\n\\nViruses that infect the respiratory tract may cause pneumonia. Viral pneumonia is often mild and goes away on its own within a few weeks. But sometimes it is serious enough that you need to get treatment in a hospital. If you have viral pneumonia, you are at risk of also getting bacterial pneumonia. The different viruses that can cause pneumonia include:\\nRespiratory syncytial virus (RSV)\\nSome common cold and flu viruses\\nSARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19\\n\\nFungal pneumonia is more common in people who have chronic health problems or weakened immune systems. Some of the types include:\\nPneumocystis pneumonia (PCP)\\nCoccidioidomycosis, which causes valley fever\\nHistoplasmosis\\nCryptococcus\\n\\nWho is at risk for pneumonia?\\nAnyone can get pneumonia, but certain factors can increase your risk:\\nAge; the risk is higher for children who are age 2 and under and adults age 65 and older\\nExposure to certain chemicals, pollutants, or toxic fumes\\nLifestyle habits, such as smoking, heavy alcohol use, and malnourishment\\nBeing in a hospital, especially if you are in the ICU. Being sedated and/or on a ventilator raises the risk even more.\\nHaving a lung disease\\nHaving a weakened immune system\\nHave trouble coughing or swallowing, from a stroke or other condition\\nRecently being sick with a cold or the flu\\n\\nWhat are the symptoms of pneumonia?\\nThe symptoms of pneumonia can range from mild to severe and include:\\nFever\\nChills\\nCough, usually with phlegm (a slimy substance from deep in your lungs)\\nShortness of breath\\nChest pain when you breathe or cough\\nNausea and/or vomiting\\nDiarrhea\\n\\nThe symptoms can vary for different groups. Newborns and infants may not show any signs of the infection. Others may vomit and have a fever and cough. They might seem sick, with no energy, or be restless.\\nOlder adults and people who have serious illnesses or weak immune systems may have fewer and milder symptoms. They may even have a lower than normal temperature. Older adults who have pneumonia sometimes have sudden changes in mental awareness.\\nWhat other problems can pneumonia cause?\\nSometimes pneumonia can cause serious complications such as:\\nBacteremia, which happens when the bacteria move into the bloodstream. It is serious and can lead to septic shock.\\nLung abscesses, which are collections of pus in cavities of the lungs\\nPleural disorders, which are conditions that affect the pleura. The pleura is the tissue that covers the outside of the lungs and lines the inside of your chest cavity.\\nKidney failure\\nRespiratory failure\\n\\nHow is pneumonia diagnosed?\\nSometimes pneumonia can be hard to diagnose. This is because it can cause some of the same symptoms as a cold or the flu. It may take time for you to realize that you have a more serious condition.\\nYour health care provider may use many tools to make a diagnosis:\\nA medical history, which includes asking about your symptoms\\nA physical exam, including listening to your lungs with a stethoscope\\nVarious tests, such as\\n\\t\\t\\nA chest x-ray\\nBlood tests such as a complete blood count (CBC) to see if your immune system is actively fighting an infection\\nA Blood culture to find out whether you have a bacterial infection that has spread to your bloodstream\\n\\n\\n\\nIf you are in the hospital, have serious symptoms, are older, or have other health problems, you may also have more tests, such as:\\nSputum test, which checks for bacteria in a sample of your sputum (spit) or phlegm (slimy substance from deep in your lungs).\\nChest CT scan to see how much of your lungs is affected. It may also show if you have complications such as lung abscesses or pleural effusions.\\nPleural fluid culture, which checks for bacteria in a fluid sample that was taken from the pleural space\\nPulse oximetry or blood oxygen level test, to check how much oxygen is in your blood\\nBronchoscopy, a procedure used to look inside your lungs' airways\\n\\nWhat are the treatments for pneumonia?\\nTreatment for pneumonia depends on the type of pneumonia, which germ is causing it, and how severe it is:\\nAntibiotics treat bacterial pneumonia and some types of fungal pneumonia. They do not work for viral pneumonia.\\nIn some cases, your provider may prescribe antiviral medicines for viral pneumonia\\nAntifungal medicines treat other types of fungal pneumonia\\n\\nYou may need to be treated in a hospital if your symptoms are severe or if you are at risk for complications. While there, you may get additional treatments. For example, if your blood oxygen level is low, you may receive oxygen therapy.\\nIt may take time to recover from pneumonia. Some people feel better within a week. For other people, it can take a month or more.\\nCan pneumonia be prevented?\\nVaccines can help prevent pneumonia caused by pneumococcal bacteria or the flu virus. Having good hygiene, not smoking, and having a healthy lifestyle may also help prevent pneumonia.\\nNIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute\\n\",\n",
       " 'Lung Cancer': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nWhat is lung cancer?\\nLung cancer is cancer that forms in tissues of the lung, usually in the cells that line the air passages. It is the leading cause of cancer death in both men and women.\\nThere are two main types: small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer. These two types grow differently and are treated differently. Non-small cell lung cancer is the more common type.\\nWho is at risk for lung cancer?\\nLung cancer can affect anyone, but there are certain factors that raise your risk of getting it:\\nSmoking. This is the most important risk factor for lung cancer. Tobacco smoking causes about 9 out of 10 cases of lung cancer in men and about 8 out of 10 cases of lung cancer in women. The earlier in life you start smoking, the longer you smoke, and the more cigarettes you smoke per day, the greater your risk of lung cancer. The risk is also greater if you smoke a lot and drink alcohol every day or take beta carotene supplements. If you have quit smoking, your risk will be lower than if you had kept smoking. But you will still have a higher risk than people who never smoked.\\nSecondhand smoke, which is the combination of smoke that comes from a cigarette and smoke breathed out by a smoker. When you inhale it, you are exposed to the same cancer-causing agents as smokers, although in smaller amounts.\\nFamily history of lung cancer\\nBeing exposed to asbestos, arsenic, chromium, beryllium, nickel, soot, or tar in the workplace\\nBeing exposed to radiation, such as from\\n\\t\\nRadiation therapy to the breast or chest\\nRadon in the home or workplace\\nCertain imaging tests such as CT scans\\n\\n\\nHIV infection\\nAir pollution\\n\\nWhat are the symptoms of lung cancer?\\nSometimes lung cancer does not cause any signs or symptoms. It may be found during a chest x-ray done for another condition.\\nIf you do have symptoms, they may include:\\nChest pain or discomfort\\nA cough that doesn't go away or gets worse over time\\nTrouble breathing\\nWheezing\\nBlood in sputum (mucus coughed up from the lungs)\\nHoarseness\\nLoss of appetite\\nWeight loss for no known reason\\nFatigue\\nTrouble swallowing\\nSwelling in the face and/or veins in the neck\\n\\nHow is lung cancer diagnosed?\\nYour health care provider may use many tools to make a diagnosis:\\nA medical history, which includes asking about your symptoms\\nA family history\\nA physical exam\\nImaging tests, such as a chest x-ray or chest CT scan\\nLab tests, including tests of your blood and sputum\\nA biopsy of the lung\\n\\nIf you do have lung cancer, your provider will do other tests to find out how far it has spread through the lungs, lymph nodes, and the rest of the body. This is called staging. Knowing the type and stage of lung cancer you have helps your provider decide what kind of treatment you need.\\nWhat are the treatments for lung cancer?\\nFor most patients with lung cancer, current treatments do not cure the cancer.\\nYour treatment will depend on which type of lung cancer you have, how far it has spread, your overall health, and other factors. You may get more than one type of treatment.\\nThe treatments for small cell lung cancer include:\\nSurgery\\nChemotherapy\\nRadiation therapy\\nImmunotherapy\\nLaser therapy, which uses a laser beam to kill cancer cells\\nEndoscopic stent placement. An endoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument used to look at tissues inside the body. It may be used to put in a device called a stent. The stent helps to open an airway that has been blocked by abnormal tissue.\\n\\nThe treatments for non-small cell lung cancer include:\\nSurgery\\nRadiation therapy\\nChemotherapy\\nTargeted therapy, which uses drugs or other substances that attack specific cancer cells with less harm to normal cells\\nImmunotherapy\\nLaser therapy\\nPhotodynamic therapy (PDT), which uses a medicine and a certain type of laser light to kill cancer cells\\nCryosurgery, which uses an instrument to freeze and destroy abnormal tissue\\nElectrocautery, a treatment that uses a probe or needle heated by an electric current to destroy abnormal tissue\\n\\nCan lung cancer be prevented?\\nAvoiding the risk factors may help to prevent lung cancer:\\nQuitting smoking. If you don't smoke, don't start.\\nLower your exposure to hazardous substances at work\\nLower your exposure to radon. Radon tests can show whether your home has high levels of radon.

       " 'Acute Bronchitis': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nBronchitis is an inflammation of the bronchial tubes, the airways that carry air to your lungs. It causes a cough that often brings up mucus. It can also cause shortness of breath, wheezing, a low fever, and chest tightness. There are two main types of bronchitis: acute and chronic.\\nMost cases of acute bronchitis get better within several days. But your cough can last for several weeks after the infection is gone.\\nThe same viruses that cause colds and the flu often cause acute bronchitis. These viruses spread through the air when people cough, or though physical contact (for example, on unwashed hands). Being exposed to tobacco smoke, air pollution, dusts, vapors, and fumes can also cause acute bronchitis. Less often, bacteria can also cause acute bronchitis.\\nTo diagnose acute bronchitis, your health care provider will ask about your symptoms and listen to your breathing. You may also have other tests.\\nTreatments include rest, fluids, and aspirin (for adults) or acetaminophen to treat fever. A humidifier or steam can also help. You may need inhaled medicine to open your airways if you are wheezing. Antibiotics won't help if the cause is viral.

       " 'LDL: The \"Bad\" Cholesterol': '\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nWhat is cholesterol?\\nCholesterol is a waxy, fat-like substance that\\'s found in all the cells in your body. Your liver makes cholesterol, and it is also in some foods, such as meat and dairy products. Your body needs some cholesterol to work properly. But having too much cholesterol in your blood raises your risk of coronary artery disease.\\nWhat are LDL and HDL?\\nLDL and HDL are two types of lipoproteins. They are a combination of fat (lipid) and protein. The lipids need to be attached to the proteins so they can move through the blood. LDL and HDL have different purposes:\\nLDL stands for low-density lipoproteins. It is sometimes called the \"bad\" cholesterol because a high LDL level leads to a buildup of cholesterol in your arteries.\\nHDL stands for high-density lipoproteins. It is sometimes called the \"good\" cholesterol because it carries cholesterol from other parts of your body back to your liver. Your liver then removes the cholesterol from your body.\\n\\nHow can a high LDL level raise my risk of coronary artery disease and other diseases?\\nIf you have a high LDL level, this means that you have too much LDL cholesterol in your blood. This extra LDL, along with other substances, forms plaque. The plaque builds up in your arteries; this is a condition called atherosclerosis.\\nCoronary artery disease happens when the plaque buildup is in the arteries of your heart. It causes the arteries to become hardened and narrowed, which slows down or blocks the blood flow to your heart. Since your blood carries oxygen to your heart, this means that your heart may not be able to get enough oxygen. This can cause angina (chest pain), or if the blood flow is completely blocked, a heart attack.\\nHow do I know what my LDL level is?\\nA blood test can measure your cholesterol levels, including LDL. When and how often you should get this test depends on your age, risk factors, and family history. The general recommendations are:\\nFor people who are age 19 or younger::\\nThe first test should be between ages 9 to 11\\nChildren should have the test again every 5 years\\nSome children may have this test starting at age 2 if there is a family history of high blood cholesterol, heart attack, or stroke\\n\\nFor people who are age 20 or older::\\nYounger adults should have the test every 5 years\\nMen ages 45 to 65 and women ages 55 to 65 should have it every 1 to 2 years\\n\\nWhat can affect my LDL level?\\nThings that can affect your LDL level include:\\nDiet. Saturated fat and cholesterol in the food you eat make your blood cholesterol level rise\\nWeight. Being overweight tends to raise your LDL level, lower your HDL level, and increase your total cholesterol level\\nPhysical Activity. A lack of physical activity can lead to weight gain, which can raise your LDL level\\nSmoking. Cigarette smoking lowers your HDL cholesterol. Since HDL helps to remove LDL from your arteries, if you have less HDL, that can contribute to you having a higher LDL level.\\nAge and Sex. As women and men get older, their cholesterol levels rise. Before the age of menopause, women have lower total cholesterol levels than men of the same age. After the age of menopause, women\\'s LDL levels tend to rise.\\nGenetics. Your genes partly determine how much cholesterol your body makes. High cholesterol can run in families. For example, familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is an inherited form of high blood cholesterol.\\nMedicines. Certain medicines, including steroids, some blood pressure medicines, and HIV/AIDS medicines, can raise your LDL level.\\nOther medical conditions. Diseases such as chronic kidney disease, diabetes, and HIV/AIDS can cause a higher LDL level.\\nRace. Certain races may have an increased risk of high blood cholesterol. For example, African Americans typically have higher HDL and LDL cholesterol levels than whites.\\n\\nWhat should my LDL level be?\\nWith LDL cholesterol, lower numbers are better, because a high LDL level can raise your risk for coronary artery disease and related problems:\\n\\n\\n\\nLDL (Bad) Cholesterol Level\\nLDL Cholesterol Category\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLess than 100mg/dL\\nOptimal\\n\\n\\n100-129mg/dL\\nNear optimal/above optimal\\n\\n\\n130-159 mg/dL\\nBorderline high\\n\\n\\n160-189 mg/dL\\nHigh\\n\\n\\n190 mg/dL and above\\nVery High\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHow can I lower my LDL level?\\nThere are two main ways to lower your LDL cholesterol:\\nTherapeutic lifestyle changes (TLC). TLC includes three parts:\\n\\nHeart-healthy eating. A heart-healthy eating plan limits the amount of saturated and trans fats that you eat. Examples of eating plans that can lower your cholesterol include the Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes diet and the DASH eating plan.\\nWeight Management. If you are overweight, losing weight can help lower your LDL cholesterol.\\nPhysical Activity.

       " 'Sexually Transmitted Diseases': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nWhat are sexually transmitted diseases (STDs)?\\nSexually transmitted diseases (STDs), or sexually transmitted infections (STIs), are infections that are passed from one person to another through sexual contact. The contact is usually vaginal, oral, or anal sex. But sometimes they can spread through other intimate physical contact. This is because some STDs, like herpes and HPV, are spread by skin-to-skin contact.\\nThere are more than 20 types of STDs, including:\\nChlamydia\\nGenital herpes\\nGonorrhea\\nHIV/AIDS \\nHPV\\nPubic lice\\nSyphilis\\nTrichomoniasis\\n\\nWhat causes sexually transmitted diseases (STDs)?\\nSTDs can be caused by bacteria, viruses, and parasites.\\nWho is affected by sexually transmitted diseases (STDs)?\\nMost STDs affect both men and women, but in many cases the health problems they cause can be more severe for \\nwomen.  If a pregnant woman has an STD, it can cause serious health problems for the baby.\\nWhat are the symptoms of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs)?\\nSTDs don't always cause symptoms or may only cause mild symptoms. So it is possible to have an infection and not know it. But you can still pass it on to others.\\nIf there are symptoms, they could include:\\nUnusual discharge from the penis or vagina\\nSores or warts on the genital area\\nPainful or frequent urination\\nItching and redness in the genital area\\nBlisters or sores in or around the mouth\\nAbnormal vaginal odor\\nAnal itching, soreness, or bleeding\\nAbdominal painn\\nFever\\n\\nHow are sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) diagnosed?\\nIf you are sexually active, you should talk to your health care provider about your risk for STDs and whether you need to be tested. This is especially important since many STDs do not usually cause symptoms.\\nSome STDs may be diagnosed during a physical exam or through microscopic examination of a sore or fluid swabbed from the vagina, penis, or anus. Blood tests can diagnose other types of STDs.\\nWhat are the treatments for sexually transmitted diseases (STDs)?\\nAntibiotics can treat STDs caused by bacteria or parasites. There is no cure for STDs caused by viruses, but medicines can often help with the symptoms and lower your risk of spreading the infection.\\nCorrect usage of latex condoms greatly reduces, but does not completely eliminate, the risk of catching or spreading STDs. The most reliable way to avoid infection is to not have anal, vaginal, or oral sex.\\nThere are vaccines to prevent HPV and hepatitis B.\\nCan sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) be prevented?\\nCorrect usage of latex condoms greatly reduces, but does not completely eliminate, the risk of catching or spreading STDs.

       " 'Stress': '\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nWhat is stress?\\nStress is how your brain and body respond to a challenge or demand. When you are stressed, your body releases chemicals called hormones. The hormones make you alert and ready to act. They can raise your blood pressure, heart rate, and blood sugar levels. This response is sometimes called a \"fight or flight\" response.\\nEveryone gets stressed from time to time. There are different types of stress. It can be short-term or long-term. It can be caused by something that happens once or something that keeps happening.\\nNot all stress is bad. In fact, it can help you survive in a dangerous situation. For example, one kind of stress is the jolt you may feel when a car pulls out in front of you. This jolt of hormones helps you quickly hit the brakes to avoid an accident. A little short-term stress can sometimes be helpful. For example, the stress of having a deadline for school or your job may push you to get your work done on time. Once you finish it, that stress goes away.\\nBut stress that lasts a long time can harm your health.\\nWhat causes long-term stress?\\nLong-term stress, or chronic stress, lasts for weeks, months, or longer. As you go about your life, your body is acting as if you\\'re being threatened.\\nCauses of long-term stress include:\\n\\nRoutine stress from the demands of work, school, family needs, money problems, and other daily pressures that don\\'t stop.\\nStress from sudden, difficult changes in your life, such as divorce, illness, losing your job, or other unhappy life events that often have a long impact.\\nTraumatic stress, which may happen when you\\'re in danger of serious harm or death. Examples include being in a bad accident, a war, a flood, earthquake, or other frightening event. This type of stress can cause a long-lasting problem called post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).\\n\\nHow can long term-stress harm my health?\\nPeople respond to stress in different ways. If you\\'re stressed for a long time you may notice that you are:\\n\\nGetting sick more often than usual because stress weakens your body\\'s ability to fight germs\\nHaving stomach problems or trouble digesting food\\nHaving trouble sleeping\\nHaving headaches\\nFeeling sad, angry, or easily upset\\n\\nWhen stress keeps going, your body acts as if you\\'re always in danger. That\\'s a lot of strain that may play a part in developing serious health problems, including:\\n\\nDepression\\nAnxiety\\nHeart disease\\nHigh blood pressure\\nDiabetes (high blood sugar)\\n\\nIt\\'s possible to get used to the symptoms of stress and not even realize there\\'s a problem. So when there\\'s a lot of stress in your life, it\\'s important to pay attention to how it affects you so you can do something about it.\\nHow can I manage long-term stress?\\nSimple things that improve your mental health may be helpful in managing long-term stress, such as:\\n\\nGet regular exercise. A 30-minute daily walk can help you feel better and help keep your immune system strong, so you don\\'t get sick.\\nTry relaxing activities. You could look for an app or wellness program that uses breathing, meditation, or muscle relaxation exercises.\\nGet enough sleep every night.\\nAvoid too much caffeine.\\nDecide what you need to do now and what can wait. And focus on what you got done each day, not on what you weren\\'t able to do.\\nAsk your family or friends for support.\\n\\nWhen should I ask my health care provider for help with stress?\\nGet help if you\\'re having severe symptoms for 2 weeks or more, including:\\n\\nTrouble sleeping\\nChanges in your eating that cause unwanted changes in your weight\\nTroubles getting out of bed because of your mood\\nDifficulty focusing your thoughts\\nLosing interest in things you usually enjoy\\nNot being able to do your usual daily activities\\n\\nAlways get help right away if stress is causing you to:\\n\\nHave thoughts of harming yourself\\nFeel you can\\'t cope\\nUse drugs or alcohol more often than usual\\n\\nYour health care provider may refer you to a mental health professional such as a psychologist or social worker.\\nNIH: National Institute of Mental Health\\n',\n",

Your liver makes cholesterol, and it is also in some foods, such as meat and dairy products. Your body needs some cholesterol to work properly. But if you have too much cholesterol in your blood, you have a higher risk of coronary artery disease.\\nHow do you measure cholesterol levels?\\nA blood test called a lipoprotein panel can measure your cholesterol levels. Before the test, you'll need to fast (not eat or drink anything but water) for 9 to 12 hours. The test gives information about your:\\nTotal cholesterol - a measure of the total amount of cholesterol in your blood. It includes both low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol.\\nLDL (bad) cholesterol - the main source of cholesterol buildup and blockage in the arteries\\nHDL (good) cholesterol - HDL helps remove cholesterol from your arteries\\nNon-HDL - this number is your total cholesterol minus your HDL. Your non-HDL includes LDL and other types of cholesterol such as VLDL (very-low-density lipoprotein).\\nTriglycerides - another form of fat in your blood that can raise your risk for heart disease, especially in women\\n\\nWhat do my cholesterol numbers mean?\\nCholesterol numbers are measured in milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL). Here are the healthy levels of cholesterol, based on your age and gender:\\nAnyone age 19 or younger:\\n\\n\\n\\nType of Cholesterol\\nHealthy Level\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTotal Cholesterol\\nLess than 170mg/dL\\n\\n\\nNon-HDL\\nLess than 120mg/dL\\n\\n\\nLDL\\nLess than 100mg/dL\\n\\n\\nHDL\\nMore than 45mg/dL\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMen age 20 or older:\\n\\n\\n\\nType of Cholesterol\\nHealthy Level\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTotal Cholesterol\\n125 to 200mg/dL\\n\\n\\nNon-HDL\\nLess than 130mg/dL\\n\\n\\nLDL\\nLess than 100mg/dL\\n\\n\\nHDL\\n40mg/dL or higher\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWomen age 20 or older:\\n\\n\\n\\nType of Cholesterol\\nHealthy Level\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTotal Cholesterol\\n125 to 200mg/dL\\n\\n\\nNon-HDL\\nLess than 130mg/dL\\n\\n\\nLDL\\nLess than 100mg/dL\\n\\n\\nHDL\\n50mg/dL or higher\\n\\n\\n\\nTriglycerides are not a type of cholesterol, but they are part of a lipoprotein panel (the test that measures cholesterol levels). A normal triglyceride level is below 150 mg/dL. You might need treatment if you have triglyceride levels that are borderline high (150-199 mg/dL) or high (200 mg/dL or more).\\nHow often should I get a cholesterol test?\\nWhen and how often you should get a cholesterol test depends on your age, risk factors, and family history. The general recommendations are:\\nFor people who are age 19 or younger::\\nThe first test should be between ages 9 to 11\\nChildren should have the test again every 5 years\\nSome children may have this test starting at age 2 if there is a family history of high blood cholesterol, heart attack, or stroke\\n\\nFor people who are age 20 or older::\\nYounger adults should have the test every 5 years\\nMen ages 45 to 65 and women ages 55 to 65 should have it every 1 to 2 years\\n\\nWhat affects my cholesterol levels?\\nA variety of things can affect cholesterol levels. These are some things you can do to lower your cholesterol levels:\\nDiet. Saturated fat and cholesterol in the food you eat make your blood cholesterol level rise. Saturated fat is the main problem, but cholesterol in foods also matters. Reducing the amount of saturated fat in your diet helps lower your blood cholesterol level. Foods that have high levels of saturated fats include some meats, dairy products, chocolate, baked goods, and deep-fried and processed foods.\\nWeight. Being overweight is a risk factor for heart disease. It also tends to increase your cholesterol. Losing weight can help lower your LDL (bad) cholesterol, total cholesterol, and triglyceride levels. It also raises your HDL (good) cholesterol level.\\nPhysical Activity. Not being physically active is a risk factor for heart disease. Regular physical activity can help lower LDL (bad) cholesterol and raise HDL (good) cholesterol levels. It also helps you lose weight. You should try to be physically active for 30 minutes on most, if not all, days.\\nSmoking. Cigarette smoking lowers your HDL (good) cholesterol. HDL helps to remove bad cholesterol from your arteries. So a lower HDL can contribute to a higher level of bad cholesterol.\\n\\nThings outside of your control that can also affect cholesterol levels include:\\nAge and Sex. As women and men get older, their cholesterol levels rise. Before the age of menopause, women have lower total cholesterol levels than men of the same age. After the age of menopause, women's LDL (bad) cholesterol levels tend to rise.\\nHeredity. Your genes partly determine how much cholesterol your body makes. High blood cholesterol can run in families.\\nRace. Certain races may have an increased risk of high blood cholesterol. For example, African Americans typically have higher HDL and LDL cholesterol levels than whites.\\n\\nHow can I lower my cholesterol?\\nThere are two main ways to lower your cholesterol:\\nHeart-healthy lifestyle changes, which include:\\n\\nHeart-healthy eating. A heart-healthy eating plan limits the amount of saturated and trans fats that you eat. Examples include the Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes diet and the DASH Eating Plan.\\nWeight Management. If you are overweight, losing weight can help lower your LDL (bad) cholesterol.\\nPhysical Activity. Everyone should get regular physical activity (30 minutes on most, if not all, days).\\nManaging stress. Research has shown that chronic stress can sometimes raise your LDL cholesterol and lower your HDL cholesterol.\\nQuitting smoking. Quitting smoking can raise your HDL cholesterol. Since HDL helps to remove LDL cholesterol from your arteries, having more HDL can help to lower your LDL cholesterol.\\n\\nDrug Treatment. If lifestyle changes alone do not lower your cholesterol enough, you may also need to take medicines. There are several types of cholesterol medicines available, including statins. The medicines work in different ways and can have different side effects. Talk to your health care provider about which one is right for you.  While you are taking medicines to lower your cholesterol, you should continue with the lifestyle changes.\\n\\nNIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute\\n\",\n",

       " 'Pain': '\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nPain is a signal in your nervous system that something may be wrong. It is an unpleasant feeling, such as a prick, tingle, sting, burn, or ache. Pain may be sharp or dull. It may come and go, or it may be constant. You may feel pain in one area of your body, such as your back, abdomen, chest, pelvis, or you may feel pain all over.\\nPain can be helpful in diagnosing a problem. If you never felt pain, you might seriously hurt yourself without knowing it, or you might not realize you have a medical problem that needs treatment.\\nThere are two types of pain: acute and chronic. Acute pain usually comes on suddenly, because of a disease, injury, or inflammation. It can often be diagnosed and treated. It usually goes away, though sometimes it can turn into chronic pain. Chronic pain lasts for a long time, and can cause severe problems.\\nPain is not always curable, but there are many ways to treat it. Treatment depends on the cause and type of pain. There are drug treatments, including pain relievers. There are also non-drug treatments, such as acupuncture, physical therapy, and sometimes surgery.\\nNIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke\\n',\n",
       " 'Over-the-Counter Medicines': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nOver-the-counter (OTC) medicines are drugs you can buy without a prescription. Some OTC medicines relieve aches, pains, and itches. Some prevent or cure diseases, like tooth decay and athlete's foot. Others help manage recurring problems, like migraines and allergies.\\n In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration decides whether a medicine is safe and effective enough to sell over-the-counter. This allows you to take a more active role in your health care. But you also need to be careful to avoid mistakes. Make sure to follow the instructions on the drug label. If you don't understand the instructions, ask your pharmacist or health care provider.\\nAlso keep in mind that that there are still risks to taking OTC medicines:\\n\\nThe medicine you are taking could interact with other medicines, supplements, foods, or drinks\\nSome medicines are not right for people with certain medical conditions. For example, people with high blood pressure should not take certain decongestants.\\nSome people are allergic to certain medicines\\nMany medicines are not safe during pregnancy. If you are pregnant, check with your health care provider before taking any medicine.\\nBe careful when giving medicines to children. Make sure that you give your child the correct dose. If you are giving your child a liquid medicine, don't use a kitchen spoon. Instead use a measuring spoon or a dosing cup marked in teaspoons.\\n\\nIf you have been taking an OTC medicine but your symptoms don't go away, contact your health care provider. You should not take OTC medicines longer or in higher doses than the label recommends. \\nFood and Drug Administration\\n\",\n",

       " 'Caregiver Health': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nWhat is a caregiver?\\nA caregiver gives care to someone who needs help taking care of themselves. The person who needs help may be a child, an adult, or an older adult. They may need help because of an injury, chronic illness, or disability.\\nSome caregivers are informal caregivers. They are usually family members or friends. Other caregivers are paid professionals. Caregivers may give care at home or in a hospital or other health care setting. Sometimes they are caregiving from a distance. The types of tasks that caregivers do may include:\\nHelping with daily tasks like bathing, eating, or taking medicine\\nArranging activities and medical care\\nMaking health and financial decisions\\n\\nHow does caregiving affect the caregiver?\\nCaregiving can be rewarding. It may help to strengthen connections to a loved one. You may feel fulfillment from helping someone else. But caregiving may also be stressful and sometimes even overwhelming. Caregiving may involve meeting complex demands without any training or help. You may also be working and have children or others to care for. To meet all of the demands, you might be putting your own needs and feelings aside. But that's not good for your long-term health. But you need to make sure that you are also taking care of yourself.\\nWhat is caregiver stress?\\nMany caregivers are affected by caregiver stress. This is the stress that comes from the emotional and physical strain of caregiving. The signs include:\\nFeeling overwhelmed\\nFeeling alone, isolated, or deserted by others\\nSleeping too much or too little\\nGaining or losing a lot of weight\\nFeeling tired most of the time\\nLosing interest in activities you used to enjoy\\nBecoming easily irritated or angered\\nFeeling worried or sad often\\nHaving headaches or body aches often\\nTurning to unhealthy behaviors like smoking or drinking too much alcohol\\n\\nHow can caregiver stress affect my health?\\nLong-term caregiver stress may put you at risk for many different health problems. Some of these problems can be serious. They include:\\nDepression and anxiety\\nA weak immune system\\nExcess weight and obesity\\nChronic diseases such as heart disease, cancer, diabetes, or arthritis. Depression and obesity can raise the risk of these diseases even more.\\nProblems with short-term memory or paying attention\\n\\nWhat can I do to prevent or relieve caregiver stress?\\nTaking steps to prevent or relieve caregiver stress may help prevent health problems. Remember that if you feel better, you can take better care of your loved one. It will also be easier to focus on the rewards of caregiving. Some ways to help yourself include:\\nLearning better ways to help your loved one. For examples, hospitals offer classes that can teach you how to care for someone with an injury or illness.\\nFinding caregiving resources in your community to help you. Many communities have adult daycare services or respite services. Using one of these can give you a break from your caregiving duties.\\nAsking for and accepting help. Make a list of ways others can help you. Let helpers choose what they would like to do. For instance, someone might sit with the person you care for while you do an errand. Someone else might pick up groceries for you.\\nJoining a support group for caregivers. A support group can allow you to share stories, pick up caregiving tips, and get support from others who face the same challenges as you do.\\nBeing organized to make caregiving more manageable. Make to-do lists and set a daily routine.\\nStaying in touch with family and friends. It's important for you to have emotional support.\\nTaking care of your own health. Try to find time to be physically active on most days of the week, choose healthy foods, and get enough sleep. Make sure that you keep up with your medical care such as regular checkups and screenings.\\nConsidering taking a break from your job, if you also work and are feeling overwhelmed.

       " 'Leukemia': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nWhat is leukemia?\\nLeukemia is a term for cancers of the blood cells. Leukemia starts in blood-forming tissues such as the bone marrow. Your bone marrow makes the cells which will develop into white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. Each type of cell has a different job:\\nWhite blood cells help your body fight infection\\nRed blood cells deliver oxygen from your lungs to your tissues and organs\\nPlatelets help form clots to stop bleeding\\n\\nWhen you have leukemia, your bone marrow makes large numbers of abnormal cells. This problem most often happens with white blood cells. These abnormal cells build up in your bone marrow and blood. They crowd out the healthy blood cells and make it hard for your cells and blood to do their work.\\nWhat are the types of leukemia?\\nThere are different types of leukemia. Which type of leukemia you have depends on the type of blood cell that becomes cancer and whether it grows quickly or slowly.\\nThe type of blood cell could be:\\nLymphocytes, a type of white blood cell\\nMyeloid cells, immature cells that become white blood cells, red blood cells, or platelets\\n\\nThe different types can grow quickly or slowly:\\nAcute leukemia is fast growing. It usually gets worse quickly if it's not treated.\\nChronic leukemia is slow growing. It usually gets worse over a longer period of time.\\n\\nThe main types of leukemia are:\\nAcute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), which is the most common type of cancer in children. It can also affect adults.\\nAcute myeloid leukemia (AML), which is more common in older adults but can also affect children\\nChronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), which is one of the most common types of leukemia in adults. It often occurs during or after middle age.\\nChronic myeloid leukemia (CML), which usually occurs in adults during or after middle age\\n\\nWhat causes leukemia?\\nLeukemia happens when there are changes in the genetic material (DNA) in bone marrow cells. The cause of these genetic changes is unknown.\\nWho is at risk for leukemia?\\nFor the specific types, there are different factors which can raise your risk of getting that type. Overall, your risk of leukemia goes up as you age. It is most common over age 60.\\nWhat are the symptoms of leukemia?\\nSome of the symptoms of leukemia may include:\\nFeeling tired\\nFever or night sweats\\nEasy bruising or bleeding\\nWeight loss or loss of appetite\\nPetechiae, which are tiny red dots under the skin. They are caused by bleeding.\\n\\nOther leukemia symptoms can be different from type to type. Chromic leukemia may not cause symptoms at first.\\nHow is leukemia diagnosed?\\nYour health care provider may use many tools to diagnose leukemia:\\nA physical exam\\nA medical history\\nBlood tests, such as a complete blood count (CBC)\\nBone marrow tests. There are two main types - bone marrow aspiration and bone marrow biopsy. Both tests involve removing a sample of bone marrow and bone. The samples are sent to a lab for testing.\\nGenetic tests to look for gene and chromosome changes\\n\\nOnce the provider makes a diagnosis, there may be additional tests to see whether the cancer has spread. These include imaging tests and a lumbar puncture, which is a procedure to collect and test cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).\\nWhat are the treatments for leukemia?\\nThe treatments for leukemia depend on which type you have, how severe the leukemia is, your age, your overall health, and other factors. Some possible treatments might include:\\nChemotherapy\\nRadiation therapy\\nChemotherapy with stem cell transplant\\nTargeted therapy, which uses drugs or other substances that attack specific cancer cells with less harm to normal cells\\n\\nNIH: National Cancer Institute\\n\",\n",

These include therapy, family education, rehabilitation, and skills training.\\nNIH: National Institute of Mental Health\\n',\n",
       " 'Chlamydia Infections': '\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nWhat is chlamydia?\\nChlamydia is a common sexually transmitted disease. It is caused by bacteria called Chlamydia trachomatis. It can infect both men and women. Women can get chlamydia in the cervix, rectum, or throat. Men can get chlamydia in the urethra (inside the penis), rectum, or throat.\\nHow do you get chlamydia?\\nYou can get chlamydia during oral, vaginal, or anal sex with someone who has the infection. A woman can also pass chlamydia to her baby during childbirth.\\nIf you\\'ve had chlamydia and were treated in the past, you can get re-infected if you have unprotected sex with someone who has it.\\nWho is at risk of getting chlamydia?\\nChlamydia is more common in young people, especially young women. You are more likely to get it if you don\\'t consistently use a condom, or if you have multiple partners.\\nWhat are the symptoms of chlamydia?\\nChlamydia doesn\\'t usually cause any symptoms. So you may not realize that you have it. People with chlamydia who have no symptoms can still pass the disease to others. If you do have symptoms, they may not appear until several weeks after you have sex with an infected partner.\\nSymptoms in women include:\\nAbnormal vaginal discharge, which may have a strong smell\\nA burning sensation when urinating\\nPain during intercourse\\n\\nIf the infection spreads, you might get lower abdominal pain, pain during sex, nausea, or fever.\\nSymptoms in men include:\\nDischarge from your penis\\nA burning sensation when urinating\\nBurning or itching around the opening of your penis\\nPain and swelling in one or both testicles (although this is less common)\\n\\nIf the chlamydia infects the rectum (in men or women), it can cause rectal pain, discharge, and/or bleeding.\\nHow is chlamydia diagnosed?\\nThere are lab tests to diagnose chlamydia. Your health care provider may ask you to provide a urine sample. For women, providers sometimes use (or ask you to use) a cotton swab to get a sample from your vagina to test for chlamydia.\\nWho should be tested for chlamydia?\\nYou should go to your health provider for a test if you have symptoms of chlamydia, or if you have a partner who has a sexually transmitted disease. Pregnant women should get a test when they go to their first prenatal visit.\\nPeople at higher risk should get checked for chlamydia every year:\\nSexually active women 25 and younger\\nOlder women who have new or multiple sex partners, or a sex partner who has a sexually transmitted disease\\nMen who have sex with men (MSM)\\n\\nWhat other problems can chlamydia cause?\\nIn women, an untreated infection can spread to your uterus and fallopian tubes, causing pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). PID can cause permanent damage to your reproductive system. This can lead to long-term pelvic pain, infertility, and ectopic pregnancy. Women who have had chlamydia infections more than once are at higher risk of serious reproductive health complications.\\nMen often don\\'t have health problems from chlamydia. Sometimes it can infect the epididymis (the tube that carries sperm). This can cause pain, fever, and, rarely, infertility.\\nBoth men and women can develop reactive arthritis because of a chlamydia infection. Reactive arthritis is a type of arthritis that happens as a \"reaction\" to an infection in the body.\\nBabies born to infected mothers can get eye infections and pneumonia from chlamydia. It may also make it more likely for your baby to be born too early.\\nUntreated chlamydia may also increase your chances of getting or giving HIV/AIDS.\\nWhat are the treatments for chlamydia?\\nAntibiotics will cure the infection. You may get a one-time dose of the antibiotics, or you may need to take medicine every day for 7 days. Antibiotics cannot repair any permanent damage that the disease has caused.\\nTo prevent spreading the disease to your partner, you should not have sex until the infection has cleared up. If you got a one-time dose of antibiotics, you should wait 7 days after taking the medicine to have sex again. If you have to take medicine every day for 7 days, you should not have sex again until you have finished taking all of the doses of your medicine.\\nIt is common to get a repeat infection, so you should get tested again about three months after treatment.\\nCan chlamydia be prevented?\\nThe only sure way to prevent chlamydia is to not have vaginal, anal, or oral sex.\\nCorrect usage of latex condoms greatly reduces, but does not eliminate, the risk of catching or spreading chlamydia. If your or your partner is allergic to latex, you can use polyurethane condoms.\\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention\\n',\n",

The warts usually appear as a small bump or group of bumps in the genital area. They are flesh-colored and can be flat or look bumpy like cauliflower. Some genital warts are so small you cannot see them. In women, the warts usually occur in or around the vagina, on the cervix, or around the anus. In men, genital warts are less common. They may have warts on the tip of the penis, around the anus, or on the scrotum, thigh, or groin.\\nYou can get genital warts during oral, vaginal, or anal sex with an infected partner.  Correct usage of latex condoms greatly reduces, but does not completely eliminate, the risk of catching or spreading HPV. If your or your partner is allergic to latex, you can use polyurethane condoms. The most reliable way to avoid infection is to not have anal, vaginal, or oral sex. HPV vaccines may help prevent some of the HPV infections that cause genital warts.\\nYour health care provider usually diagnoses genital warts by seeing them. The warts might disappear on their own.

       " 'Cleaning, Disinfecting, and Sanitizing': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nWhere are germs found?\\nGerms are a part of everyday life. Some of them are helpful, but others are harmful and cause disease. They can be found everywhere - in our air, soil, and water. They are on our skin and in our bodies. Germs are also on the surfaces and objects that we touch.\\nSometimes those germs can spread to you and make you sick. For example, there could be germs on a tv remote. You could get infected with the germs if you touch the remote and then rub your eyes or nose or eat with your hands.\\nHow can I avoid getting germs from surfaces and objects?\\nTo avoid becoming infected by germs from surfaces and objects, it is important to wash your hands often. But you can't wash your hands every time you touch something. So it's also important to regularly clean and disinfect surfaces and objects.\\nWhat is the difference between cleaning, sanitizing, and disinfecting?\\nSome people think that disinfecting is same thing as cleaning or sanitizing. But they are actually different:\\n\\nCleaning removes dirt, dust, crumbs, and germs from surfaces or objects. When you clean, you will likely use soap (or detergent) and water to physically clean off the surfaces and objects. This may not necessarily kill the germs. But since you removed some of them, there are fewer germs that could spread infection to you.\\nDisinfecting uses chemicals (disinfectants) to kill germs on surfaces and objects. Some common disinfectants are bleach and alcohol solutions. You usually need to leave the disinfectant on the surfaces and objects for a certain period of time to kill the germs. Disinfecting does not necessarily clean dirty surfaces or remove germs. \\nSanitizing could be done by either cleaning, disinfecting, or both. Sanitizing means that you are lowering the number of germs to a safe level. What is considered a safe level depends on public health standards or requirements at a workplace, school, etc. For example, there are sanitizing procedures for restaurants and other facilities that prepare food. What you do to sanitize will vary, depending on your needs. You might be mopping a floor using a mop, a chemical, and water. You might use a dishwasher to sanitize the dishes. Or you could be using an antibacterial wipe on a tv remote.\\n\\nIf you both clean and disinfect a surface or object, you can further lower the risk of spreading infection. There are products that clean and disinfect at the same time.\\nWhich surfaces and objects do I need to clean and disinfect?\\nTo prevent the spread of infection, you should regularly clean and disinfect surfaces and objects that are touched often. For example, in your house, this would include countertops, doorknobs, faucet and toilet handles, light switches, remotes, and toys.\\nHow can I safely clean and disinfect?\\nIt's important to be safe when using cleaning and disinfecting products:\\n\\nStore them in the containers they came in. Always follow the instructions and pay attention to the warnings on the label. \\nDo not mix cleaners and disinfectants unless the labels say that it is safe to do so. Combining certain products (such as chlorine bleach and ammonia cleaners) can cause serious injury or even death.\\nCheck the label to see whether you need to use gloves to protect your hands and/or eye protection when using the products\\nIf you swallow, inhale, or get them on your skin, follow the directions on the label or get medical help\\nStore them out of the reach of children\\n\\n\",\n",

Smoking, drinking too much alcohol, using some medicines, being tired, and having ongoing stress can also cause indigestion or make it worse. Sometimes the cause is a problem with the digestive tract, like an ulcer or GERD.\\nAvoiding foods and situations that seem to cause it may help. Because indigestion can be a sign of a more serious problem, see your health care provider if it lasts for more than two weeks or if you have severe pain or other symptoms.

A fever is not a disease. It is usually a sign that your body is trying to fight an illness or infection.\\nInfections cause most fevers. You get a fever because your body is trying to kill the virus or bacteria that caused the infection. Most of those bacteria and viruses do well when your body is at your normal temperature. But if you have a fever, it is harder for them to survive. Fever also activates your body's immune system.\\nOther causes of fevers include:\\nMedicines, including some antibiotics, blood pressure medicines, and anti-seizure medicines\\nHeat illness\\nCancers\\nAutoimmune diseases\\nSome childhood vaccines\\n\\nTreatment depends on the cause of your fever. If the fever is very high, your health care provider may recommend taking an over-the-counter medicine such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen. Adults can also take aspirin, but children with fevers should not take aspirin. It is also important to drink enough liquids, to prevent dehydration.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Cancer Chemotherapy': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nWhat is cancer chemotherapy?\\nCancer chemotherapy is a type of cancer treatment. It uses medicines to destroy cancer cells.\\nNormally, the cells in your body grow and die in a controlled way. Cancer cells keep growing without control. Chemotherapy works by killing the cancer cells, stopping them from spreading, or slowing their growth.\\nChemotherapy is used to:\\n\\nTreat cancer by curing the cancer, lessening the chance it will return, or stopping or slowing its growth.\\nEase cancer symptoms by shrinking tumors that are causing pain and other problems.\\n\\nWhat are the side effects of chemotherapy?\\nChemotherapy does not just destroy cancer cells. It can also harm some healthy cells, which causes side effects.\\nYou may have a lot of side effects, some side effects, or none at all. It depends on the type and amount of chemotherapy you get and how your body reacts.\\nSome common side effects are:\\n\\nMouth sores\\nFatigue\\nNausea and vomiting\\nPain\\nHair loss\\n\\nThere are ways to prevent or control some side effects. Talk with your health care provider about how to manage them. Healthy cells usually recover after chemotherapy is over, so most side effects gradually go away.\\nWhat can I expect when getting chemotherapy?\\nYou may get chemotherapy in a hospital or at home, a doctor's office, or a medical clinic. You might be given the medicines by mouth, in a shot, as a cream, through a catheter, or intravenously (by IV).\\nYour treatment plan will depend on the type of cancer you have, which chemotherapy medicines are used, the treatment goals, and how your body responds to the medicines.\\nChemotherapy may be given alone or with other treatments. You may get treatment every day, every week, or every month. You may have breaks between treatments so that your body has a chance to build new healthy cells.\\nNIH: National Cancer Institute\\n\",\n",
       " 'Testicular Disorders': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nTesticles, or testes, make male hormones and sperm. They are two egg-shaped organs inside the scrotum, the loose sac of skin behind the penis. It's easy to injure your testicles because they are not protected by bones or muscles. Men and boys should wear athletic supporters when they play sports. \\nYou should examine your testicles monthly and seek medical attention for lumps, redness, pain or other changes. Testicles can get inflamed or infected. They can also develop cancer. Testicular cancer is rare and highly treatable. It usually happens between the ages of 15 and 40.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " 'Endocrine Diseases': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nYour endocrine system includes eight major glands throughout your body. These glands make hormones. Hormones are chemical messengers.  They travel through your bloodstream to tissues or organs. Hormones work slowly and affect body processes from head to toe. These include:\\nGrowth and development\\nMetabolism - digestion, elimination, breathing, blood circulation and maintaining body temperature \\nSexual function\\nReproduction\\nMood\\n\\nIf your hormone levels are too high or too low, you may have a hormone disorder. Hormone diseases also occur if your body does not respond to hormones the way it is supposed to.  Stress, infection and changes in your blood's fluid and electrolyte balance can also influence hormone levels.\\nIn the United States, the most common endocrine disease is diabetes. There are many others. They are usually treated by controlling how much hormone your body makes. Hormone supplements can help if the problem is too little of a hormone.\\n\\n\",\n",

       " 'Vaginitis': '\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nWhat is vaginitis?\\nVaginitis, also called vulvovaginitis, is an inflammation or infection of the vagina. It can also affect the vulva, which is the external part of a woman\\'s genitals. Vaginitis can cause itching, pain, discharge, and odor.\\nVaginitis is common, especially in women in their reproductive years.  It usually happens when there is a change in the balance of bacteria or yeast that are normally found in your vagina. There are different types of vaginitis, and they have different causes, symptoms, and treatments.\\nWhat  causes vaginitis?\\nBacterial vaginosis (BV) is the most common vaginal infection in women ages 15-44. It happens when there is an imbalance between the \"good\" and \"harmful\" bacteria that are normally found in a woman\\'s vagina. Many things can change the balance of bacteria, including:\\nTaking antibiotics\\nDouching\\nUsing an intrauterine device (IUD)\\nHaving unprotected sex with a new partner\\nHaving many sexual partners\\n\\nYeast infections (candidiasis) happen when too much candida grows in the vagina. Candida is the scientific name for yeast. It is a fungus that lives almost everywhere, including in your body. You may have too much growing in the vagina because of:\\nAntibiotics\\nPregnancy\\nDiabetes, especially if it is not well-controlled\\nCorticosteroid medicines\\n\\nTrichomoniasis can also cause vaginitis. Trichomoniasis is a common sexually transmitted disease. It is caused by a parasite.\\nYou can also have vaginitis if you are allergic or sensitive to certain products that you use. Examples include vaginal sprays, douches, spermicides, soaps, detergents, or fabric softeners. They can cause burning, itching, and discharge.\\nHormonal changes can also cause vaginal irritation. Examples are when you are pregnant or breastfeeding, or when you have gone through menopause.\\nSometimes you can have more than one cause of vaginitis at the same time.\\nWhat are the symptoms of vaginitis?\\nThe symptoms of vaginitis depend on which type you have.\\nWith BV, you may not have symptoms. You could have a thin white or gray vaginal discharge. There may be an odor, such as a strong fish-like odor, especially after sex.\\nYeast infections produce a thick, white discharge from the vagina that can look like cottage cheese. The discharge can be watery and often has no smell. Yeast infections usually cause the vagina and vulva to become itchy and red.\\nYou may not have symptoms when you have trichomoniasis. If you do have them, they include itching, burning, and soreness of the vagina and vulva. You may have burning during urination. You could also have gray-green discharge, which may smell bad.\\nHow is the cause of vaginitis diagnosed?\\nTo find out the cause of your symptoms, your health care provider may:\\nAsk you about your medical history\\nDo a pelvic exam\\nLook for vaginal discharge, noting its color, qualities, and any odor\\nStudy a sample of your vaginal fluid under a microscope\\n\\nIn some cases, you may need more tests.\\nWhat are the treatments for vaginitis?\\nThe treatment depends on which type of vaginitis you have.\\nBV is treatable with antibiotics. You may get pills to swallow, or cream or gel that you put in your vagina. During treatment, you should use a condom during sex or not have sex at all.\\nYeast infections are usually treated with a cream or with medicine that you put inside your vagina. You can buy over-the-counter treatments for yeast infections, but you need to be sure that you do have a yeast infection and not another type of vaginitis. See your health care provider if this is the first time you have had symptoms. Even if you have had yeast infections before, it is a good idea to call your health care provider before using an over-the-counter treatment.\\nThe treatment for trichomoniasis is usually a single-dose antibiotic. Both you and your partner(s) should be treated, to prevent spreading the infection to others and to keep from getting it again.\\nIf your vaginitis is due to an allergy or sensitivity to a product, you need to figure out which product is causing the problem. It could be a product that you started using recently. Once you figure it out, you should stop using the product.\\nIf the cause of your vaginitis is a hormonal change, your health care provider may give you estrogen cream to help with your symptoms.\\nCan vaginitis cause other health problems?\\nIt is important to treat BV and trichomoniasis, because having either of them can increase your risk for getting HIV or another sexually transmitted disease. If you are pregnant, BV or trichomoniasis can increase your risk for preterm labor and preterm birth.\\nCan vaginitis be prevented?\\nTo help prevent vaginitis:\\nDo not douche or use vaginal sprays\\nUse a latex condom when having sex. If your or your partner is allergic to latex, you can use polyurethane condoms.\\nAvoid clothes that hold in heat and moisture\\nWear cotton underwear\\n\\n',\n",
       " 'Abscess': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nAn abscess is a pocket of pus. You can get an abscess almost anywhere in your body. When an area of your body becomes infected, your body's immune system tries to fight the infection. White blood cells go to the infected area, collect within the damaged tissue, and cause inflammation. During this process, pus forms. Pus is a mixture of living and dead white blood cells, germs, and dead tissue. \\nBacteria, viruses, parasites and swallowed objects can all lead to abscesses. Skin abscesses are easy to detect. They are red, raised and painful. Abscesses inside your body may not be obvious and can damage organs, including the brain, lungs and others. Treatments include drainage and antibiotics. \\n\",\n",
       " 'Ischemic Stroke': '\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nA stroke is a medical emergency. There are two types - ischemic and hemorrhagic. Ischemic stroke is the more common type. It is usually caused by a blood clot that blocks or plugs a blood vessel in the brain. This keeps blood from flowing to the brain. Within minutes, brain cells begin to die.  Another cause is stenosis, or narrowing of the artery. This can happen because of atherosclerosis, a disease in which plaque builds up inside your arteries. Transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) occur when the blood supply to the brain is interrupted briefly. Having a TIA can mean you are at risk for having a more serious stroke.\\nSymptoms of stroke are:\\nSudden numbness or weakness of the face, arm or leg (especially on one side of the body)\\nSudden confusion, trouble speaking or understanding speech\\nSudden trouble seeing in one or both eyes\\nSudden trouble walking, dizziness, loss of balance or coordination\\nSudden severe headache with no known cause\\n\\nIt is important to treat strokes as quickly as possible. Blood thinners may be used to stop a stroke while it is happening by quickly dissolving the blood clot. Post-stroke rehabilitation can help people overcome disabilities caused by stroke damage.\\nNIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke\\n',\n",

A burning stomach pain is the most common symptom. The pain:\\nStarts between meals or during the night\\nBriefly stops if you eat or take antacids\\nLasts for minutes to hours\\nComes and goes for several days or weeks\\n\\nPeptic ulcers happen when the acids that help you digest food damage the walls of the stomach or duodenum. The most common cause is infection with a bacterium called Helicobacter pylori. Another cause is the long-term use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medicines (NSAIDs) such as aspirin and ibuprofen. Stress and spicy foods do not cause ulcers, but can make them worse. \\nTo see if you have an H. pylori infection, your doctor will test your blood, breath, or stool. Your doctor also may look inside your stomach and duodenum by doing an endoscopy or x-ray.\\nPeptic ulcers will get worse if not treated. Treatment may include medicines to reduce stomach acids or antibiotics to kill H. pylori. Antacids and milk can't heal peptic ulcers. Not smoking and avoiding alcohol can help.

       " 'Carbohydrate Metabolism Disorders': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nMetabolism is the process your body uses to make energy from the food you eat. Food is made up of proteins, carbohydrates, and fats. Chemicals in your digestive system (enzymes) break the food parts down into sugars and acids, your body's fuel. Your body can use this fuel right away, or it can store the energy in your body tissues. If you have a metabolic disorder, something goes wrong with this process.\\nCarbohydrate metabolism disorders are a group of metabolic disorders. Normally your enzymes break carbohydrates down into glucose (a type of sugar). If you have one of these disorders, you may not have enough enzymes to break down the carbohydrates. Or the enzymes may not work properly. This causes a harmful amount of sugar to build up in your body. That can lead to health problems, some of which can be serious. Some of the disorders are fatal.\\nThese disorders are inherited. Newborn babies get screened for many of them, using blood tests. If there is a family history of one of these disorders, parents can get genetic testing to see whether they carry the gene. Other genetic tests can tell whether the fetus has the disorder or carries the gene for the disorder.\\nTreatments may include special diets, supplements, and medicines. Some babies may also need additional treatments, if there are complications. For some disorders, there is no cure, but treatments may help with symptoms.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Dislocated Shoulder': '\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nWhat is a dislocated shoulder?\\nYour shoulder joint is made up of three bones: your collarbone, your shoulder blade, and your upper arm bone. The top of your upper arm bone is shaped like a ball. This ball fits into a cuplike socket in your shoulder blade. A shoulder dislocation is an injury that happens when the ball pops out of your socket. A dislocation may be partial, where the ball is only partially out of the socket. It can also be a full dislocation, where the ball is completely out of the socket.\\nWhat causes a dislocated shoulder?\\nYour shoulders are the most movable joints in your body. They are also the most commonly dislocated joints.\\nThe most common causes of shoulder dislocations are:\\nSports injuries\\nAccidents, including traffic accidents\\nFalling on your shoulder or outstretched arm\\nSeizures and electric shocks, which can cause muscle contractions that pull the arm out of place\\n\\nWho is at risk for a dislocated shoulder?\\nA dislocated shoulder can happen to anyone, but they are more common in young men, who are more often involved in sports and other physical activities. Older adults, especially women, are also at higher risk because they are more likely to fall.\\nWhat are the symptoms of a dislocated shoulder?\\nThe symptoms of a dislocated shoulder include:\\nSevere shoulder pain\\nSwelling and bruising of your shoulder or upper arm\\nNumbness and/or weakness in your arm, neck, hand, or fingers\\nTrouble moving your arm\\nYour arm seems to be out of place\\nMuscle spasms in your shoulder\\n\\nIf you are having these symptoms, get medical treatment right away.\\nHow is a dislocated shoulder diagnosed?\\nTo make a diagnosis, your health care provider will take a medical history and examine your shoulder. Your provider may also ask you to get an x-ray to confirm the diagnosis.\\nWhat are the treatments for a dislocated shoulder?\\nThe treatment for dislocated shoulder usually involves three steps:\\nThe first step is a closed reduction, a procedure in which your health care provider puts the ball of your upper arm back into the socket. You may first get medicine to relieve the pain and relax your shoulder muscles. Once the joint is back in place, the severe pain should end.\\nThe second step is wearing a sling or other device to keep your shoulder in place. You will wear it for a few days to several weeks.\\nThe third step is rehabilitation, once the pain and swelling have improved. You will do exercises to improve your range of motion and strengthen your muscles.\\n\\nYou may need surgery if you injure the tissues or nerves around the shoulder or if you get repeated dislocations.\\nA dislocation can make your shoulder unstable. When that happens, it takes less force to dislocate it. This means that there is a higher risk of it happening again. Your health care provider may ask you to continue doing some exercises to prevent another dislocation.\\n',\n",

       " 'Genetic Brain Disorders': '\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nA genetic brain disorder is caused by a variation or a mutation in a gene.  A variation is a different form of a gene. A mutation is a change in a gene. Genetic brain disorders affect the development and function of the brain.\\nSome genetic brain disorders are due to random gene mutations or mutations caused by environmental exposure, such as cigarette smoke. Other disorders are inherited, which means that a mutated gene or group of genes is passed down through a family. They can also be due to a combination of both genetic changes and other outside factors.\\nSome examples of genetic brain disorders include:\\nLeukodystrophies\\nPhenylketonuria\\nTay-Sachs disease\\nWilson disease\\n\\nMany people with genetic brain disorders fail to produce enough of certain proteins that influence brain development and function.

It\\'s also called cardiovascular disease, which means heart and blood vessel disease.\\nCoronary artery disease (also called coronary heart disease) is the most common type of heart disease in both men and women. It happens slowly over time when a sticky substance called plaque builds up in the arteries that supply your heart muscle with blood. The plaque narrows or blocks blood flow to the heart muscle and can lead to:\\n\\nAngina - chest pain from lack of blood flow\\nHeart attacks - when part of the heart muscle dies from loss of blood flow\\nHeart failure - when your heart can\\'t pump enough blood to meet your body\\'s needs\\nArrhythmia - a problem with the rate or rhythm of your heartbeat\\n\\nHow does heart disease affect women?\\nIn the United States, heart disease is the number one cause of death in women. But women are often not diagnosed with heart disease as quickly as men are. That\\'s because:\\n\\nWomen are more likely than men to have \"silent\" heart disease, meaning that they don\\'t have symptoms.\\nHealth care providers may not recognize heart disease in women because women\\'s symptoms may be different from men\\'s symptoms.\\nWomen are more likely than men to have certain types of heart disease that can be harder to diagnose.\\n\\nA delay in diagnosis may mean a delay in medical care that could help prevent serious problems, such as a heart attack. That\\'s why it\\'s important to learn about your risk for heart disease, the symptoms in women, and how to keep your heart healthy.\\nWhat types of heart disease do women get?\\nWomen can get any type of heart disease. Like men, the most common type of heart disease among women is coronary artery disease. But there are certain types of heart disease which are less common, but affect women more often than men:\\n\\nCoronary microvascular disease - Chest pain from spasms (sudden tightening) in the smallest arteries of the heart that pinch off blood flow. It typically happens during rest or routine activities. This serious condition increases your risk of having a heart attack or other heart diseases.  This type may be harder to diagnose since blockages in smaller arteries can be harder to see on imaging tests.\\nBroken heart syndrome - Strong chest pain or other signs that look like a heart attack. It\\'s caused by the stress of powerful emotions, such as deep grief, anger, or surprise. It can happen even if you\\'re healthy. It mostly affects women after menopause and usually doesn\\'t cause any lasting damage.\\nVariant angina - A rare type of strong chest pain from spasms in the heart arteries. The pain usually happens in a pattern during sleep. Variant angina rarely causes a heart attack.\\n\\nWhich women are more likely to develop heart disease?\\nYour risk for developing heart disease increases with:\\n\\nMenopause. Women can develop heart disease at any age, but your risk increases after your periods stop, usually by age 55. Before menopause, your body makes more estrogen (a female hormone) which helps protect against heart disease. That\\'s why women generally develop coronary artery disease 10 years later than men. During and after menopause, estrogen levels drop and your risk for heart diseases goes up. If your periods stop before age 40, your risk will be higher than other women your age.\\nFamily history of heart disease. Your risk for heart disease may be higher if your:\\n\\t\\nMother or sister had heart disease before age 65.\\nFather or brother had heart disease before age 55.\\n\\n\\nProblems during pregnancy, such as  high blood pressure, gestational diabetes, anemia, and high blood pressure.\\nUse of hormonal birth control (pills, patches, or vaginal rings with estrogen and progesterone).\\nEndometriosis.\\nPolycystic ovary syndrome.\\nInflammatory and autoimmune diseases.\\nMetabolic syndrome.\\nMental health issues, such as stress, anxiety, or depression.\\nHealth risks from a lack physical activity.\\nObesity or being overweight.\\nDiabetes.\\nLow HDL cholesterol levels.\\nMild to moderate high blood pressure.\\nSmoking.\\n\\nIf you have one or more risks for heart disease, ask your health care provider for help understanding your risk level. Ask if you need any heart tests to help catch heart disease early.\\nWhat are the symptoms of heart disease and heart attack in women?\\nWhen women have symptoms of heart disease, they may include:\\n\\nPain or discomfort in the chest that may be dull and heavy or sharp\\nPain in the neck, jaw, throat, upper belly, or back\\nNausea or vomiting\\nUnusual fatigue\\nShortness of breath (feeling like you can\\'t get enough air) during physical activity\\n\\nWomen who have coronary artery disease are more likely than men to have chest pain when resting or doing daily activities, rather than during exercise. They\\'re also more likely than men to feel chest pain from mental stress.\\nSymptoms of a heart attack in women may also be different than in men. Chest pain is the most common symptom for both sexes. It may feel like crushing or squeezing. But women are somewhat less likely than men to have chest pain.\\nDuring a heart attack, women may feel:\\n\\nPressure or tightness in the chest\\nPain in the upper back, arms, neck, jaw or throat\\nDizziness\\nUnusual fatigue\\nIndigestion, heartburn, nausea, or vomiting \\nStomach pain\\nShortness of breath\\n\\nHeart attacks usually don\\'t look like the sudden, dramatic events we see in the movies.

       " 'Blood': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nYour blood is made up of liquid and solids. The liquid part, called plasma, is made of water, salts, and protein. Over half of your blood is plasma. The solid part of your blood contains red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.\\nRed blood cells (RBC) deliver oxygen from your lungs to your tissues and organs. White blood cells (WBC) fight infection and are part of your immune system. Platelets help blood to clot when you have a cut or wound. Bone marrow, the spongy material inside your bones, makes new blood cells. Blood cells constantly die and your body makes new ones. Red blood cells live about 120 days, and platelets live about 6 days. Some white blood cells live less than a day, but others live much longer.\\nThere are four blood types: A, B, AB, or O. Also, blood is either Rh-positive or Rh-negative. So if you have type A blood, it's either A positive or A negative. Which type you are is important if you need a blood transfusion. And your Rh factor could be important if you become pregnant - an incompatibility between your type and the baby's could create problems. \\nBlood tests such as blood count tests help doctors check for certain diseases and conditions. They also help check the function of your organs and show how well treatments are working. Problems with your blood may include bleeding disorders, excessive clotting and platelet disorders.

Antibiotics do not work for viral infections. There are antiviral medicines to treat some viral infections. Vaccines can help prevent you from getting many viral diseases.\\n',\n",
       " 'Pancreas Transplantation': '\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nThe pancreas is a gland behind your stomach and in front of your spine. It produces the juices that help break down food and the hormones that help control blood sugar levels. A pancreas transplant is surgery to place a healthy pancreas from a donor into a person with a diseased pancreas.  It is mostly done for people with severe type 1 diabetes. It can allow them to give up insulin shots.  An experimental procedure called islet cell transplantation transplants only the parts of the pancreas that make insulin.\\nPeople who have transplants must take drugs to keep their body from rejecting the new pancreas for the rest of their lives. They must also have regular follow-up care. Because of the risks, it is not a common treatment for type 1 diabetes.\\n',\n",
       " 'Testicular Cancer': '\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nTesticles, or testes, make male hormones and sperm. They are two egg-shaped organs inside the scrotum, the loose sac of skin behind the penis.  You can get cancer in one or both testicles.\\nTesticular cancer mainly affects young men between the ages of 20 and 39. It is also more common in men who:\\nHave had abnormal testicle development\\nHave had an undescended testicle\\nHave a family history of the cancer\\n\\nSymptoms include pain, swelling, or lumps in your testicles or groin area. Doctors use a physical exam, lab tests, imaging tests, and a biopsy to diagnose testicular cancer. Most cases can be treated, especially if found early. Treatment options include surgery, radiation, and/or chemotherapy. Regular exams after treatment are important.\\nTreatments may also cause infertility. If you may want children later on, you should consider sperm banking before treatment.\\nNIH: National Cancer Institute\\n',\n",
       " 'Heart Valve Diseases': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nWhat are heart valve diseases?\\nHeart valve disease happens when one or more of your heart valves don't work well.\\nYour heart has four valves: the tricuspid, pulmonary, mitral, and aortic valves. The valves have flaps that open and close. The flaps make sure that blood flows in the right direction through your heart and to the rest of your body. When your heart beats, the flaps open to let blood through. Between heartbeats they close to stop the blood from flowing backwards.\\nIf one or more of your heart valves doesn't open or close correctly, it can affect your blood flow and strain your heart. Fortunately, treatment helps most valve diseases.\\nWhat are the types of heart valve diseases?\\nHeart valves can have three basic kinds of problems:\\n\\nRegurgitation, or backflow, happens when the flaps of a valve don't close tightly. This allows the blood to leak backwards. A common cause of regurgitation is prolapse, where the flaps of the valve flop or bulge back. Prolapse most often affects the mitral valve.\\nStenosis happens when the flaps of a valve become thick, stiff, or stuck together. This prevents the heart valve from opening all the way. Not enough blood can pass through the valve. Aortic valve stenosis is a common type of stenosis. It affects the valve that controls blood flow into the large artery that carries blood out of the heart to the body.\\nAtresia happens when a heart valve did not form properly and does not have an opening for blood to pass through.\\n\\nSometimes a valve can have both regurgitation and stenosis.\\nWhat causes heart valve diseases?\\nSome people are born with heart valve disease. This is called congenital heart valve disease. It can happen alone or along with other congenital heart defects. Heart valve disease can also develop over time as you get older or have certain conditions that affect the heart.\\nWho is more likely to develop heart valve diseases?\\nYour chance of having heart valve disease is higher if:\\n\\nYou are older. With age, the heart valves can become thick and stiff.\\nYou have or have had other conditions that affect your heart and blood vessels. These include:\\n\\t\\nRheumatic fever. An untreated strep throat can become rheumatic fever, which can harm the heart valves. The damage may not show up for years. Today, most people take antibiotics to cure strep throat before it can cause heart valve damage.\\nEndocarditis. This is a rare infection in the lining of the heart and heart valves. It is usually caused by bacteria in the bloodstream.\\nA heart attack.\\nHeart failure.\\nCoronary artery disease, especially when it affects the aorta (the large artery that carries blood from the heart to the body).\\nHigh blood pressure.\\nHigh blood cholesterol.\\nDiabetes.\\nObesity and overweight.\\nLack of physical activity.\\n\\n\\nA family history of early heart disease:\\n\\nA father or brother who had heart disease younger than 55.\\nA mother or sister who had heart disease younger than 65.\\n\\n\\nYou were born with an aortic valve that wasn't formed right. Sometimes this will cause problems right away. Other times, the valve may work well enough for years before causing problems.\\n\\nWhat are the symptoms of heart valve diseases?\\nMany people live their whole lives with a heart valve that doesn't work perfectly and never have any problems. But heart valve disease may get worse slowly over time. You may develop signs and symptoms, such as:\\n\\nShortness of breath (feeling like you can't get enough air)\\nFatigue\\nSwelling in your feet, ankles, abdomen (belly), or the veins in your neck\\nChest pain when you're physically active\\nArrhythmia, a problem with the rate or rhythm of your heartbeat\\nDizziness or fainting\\n\\nIf you don't get treatment for heart valve disease, the symptoms and strain on your heart may keep getting worse.\\nWhat other problems can heart valve diseases cause?\\nWhen the valves don't work well, your heart has to pump harder to get enough blood out to the body.  Without treatment, this extra workload on your heart can lead to:\\n\\nHeart failure\\nStroke\\nBlood clots\\nSudden cardiac arrest or death\\n\\nHow is heart valve disease diagnosed?\\nYour health care provider may listen to your heart with a stethoscope and hear that your heart makes abnormal sounds, such as a click or a heart murmur. These sounds may mean a valve isn't working normally. The provider will usually refer you to a cardiologist, a doctor who specializes in heart diseases.\\nThe doctor will also listen to your heart and will do a physical exam. You will also likely need to have one or more heart tests.\\nWhat are the treatments for heart valve diseases?\\nMost heart valve problems can be treated successfully. Treatment may include:\\n\\nMedicines to control your symptoms and keep your heart pumping well\\nHeart-healthy lifestyle changes to treat other related heart conditions\\nSurgery to repair or replace a valve\\n\\nIt's possible that you may need surgery, even if you don't have symptoms. Fixing the valve can help can prevent future heart problems.\\nThere are many ways to do heart valve surgery. You and your doctor can decide what's best for you, based on your valve problem and general health. Heart valve repair surgery has fewer risks than heart valve replacement. So, when repair is possible, it's preferred over valve replacement.\\nIn some cases, valve replacement is necessary. There are 2 types of replacement valves:\\n\\nBiologic valves made from pig, cow, or human tissue. These valves tend to wear out after 10 to 15 years, but some may last longer.\\nMechanical (human-made) valves usually don't wear out. But with a mechanical valve, you usually have to take blood thinners for the rest of your life to prevent blood clots. And your risk of endocarditis (a heart infection) is higher than with a biologic valve.\\n\\nNIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute\\n\",\n",
       " 'Tracheal Disorders': '\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nYour trachea, or windpipe, is one part of your airway system. Airways are pipes that carry oxygen-rich air to your lungs. They also carry carbon dioxide, a waste gas, out of your lungs. \\nWhen you inhale, air travels from your nose, through your larynx, and down your windpipe. The windpipe splits into two bronchi that enter your lungs.\\nProblems with the trachea include narrowing, inflammation, and some inherited conditions.  You may need a procedure called a tracheostomy to help you breathe if you have swallowing problems, or have conditions that affect coughing or block your airways.  You might also need a tracheostomy if you are in critical care and need to be on a breathing machine.\\nNIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute\\n',\n",

       " 'Hypoglycemia': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nHypoglycemia means low blood glucose, or blood sugar. Your body needs glucose to have enough energy. After you eat, your blood absorbs glucose. If you eat more sugar than your body needs, your muscles, and liver store the extra. When your blood sugar begins to fall, a hormone tells your liver to release glucose.\\nIn most people, this raises blood sugar. If it doesn't, you have hypoglycemia, and your blood sugar can be dangerously low. Signs include :\\nHunger\\nShakiness\\nDizziness\\nConfusion\\nDifficulty speaking\\nFeeling anxious or weak\\n\\nIn people with diabetes, hypoglycemia is often a side effect of diabetes medicines. Eating or drinking something with carbohydrates can help. If it happens often, your health care provider may need to change your treatment plan.\\nYou can also have low blood sugar without having diabetes.  Causes include certain medicines or diseases, hormone or enzyme deficiencies, and tumors. Laboratory tests can help find the cause. The kind of treatment depends on why you have low blood sugar.\\nNIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases\\n\",\n",
       " 'Prediabetes': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nWhat is prediabetes?\\nPrediabetes means that your blood glucose, or blood sugar, levels are higher than normal but not high enough to be called diabetes. Glucose comes from the foods you eat. Too much glucose in your blood can damage your body over time.\\nIf you have prediabetes, you are more likely to develop type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and stroke. But if you make some lifestyle changes now, you may be able to delay or prevent type 2 diabetes.\\nWhat causes prediabetes?\\nPrediabetes usually happens when your body has a problem with insulin. Insulin is a hormone that helps the glucose get into your cells to give them energy. A problem with insulin could be:\\nInsulin resistance, a condition in which the body can't use its insulin properly. It makes it hard for your cells to get glucose from your blood. This can cause your blood sugar levels to rise.\\nYour body can't make enough insulin to keep your blood sugar levels at a healthy level\\n\\nResearchers think that being overweight and not getting regular physical activity are major factors in causing prediabetes.\\nWho is at risk for prediabetes?\\nAbout 1 out of every 3 adults has prediabetes. It is more common in people who:\\nAre overweight or have obesity\\nAre age 45 or older\\nHave a parent, brother, or sister with diabetes\\nAre African American, Alaska Native, American Indian, Asian American, Hispanic/Latino, Native Hawaiian, or Pacific Islander American\\nAre not physically active\\nHave health conditions such as high blood pressure and high cholesterol\\nHave had gestational diabetes (diabetes in pregnancy)\\nHave a history of heart disease or stroke\\nHave metabolic syndrome\\nHave polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)\\n\\nWhat are the symptoms of prediabetes?\\nMost people don't know they have prediabetes because usually there are no symptoms.\\nSome people with prediabetes may have darkened skin in the armpit or on the back and sides of the neck. They may also have many small skin growths in those same areas.\\nHow is prediabetes diagnosed?\\nThere are a few different blood tests that can diagnose prediabetes. The most common ones are:\\nFasting plasma glucose (FPG) test, which measures your blood sugar at a single point in time. You need to fast (not eat or drink) for at least 8 hours before the test. The results of the test are given in mg/dL (milligrams per deciliter):\\n\\t\\t\\nA normal level is 99 or below\\nPrediabetes is 100 to 125\\nType 2 diabetes is 126 and above\\n\\n\\nA1C test, which measures your average blood sugar over the past 3 months.

       " 'How to Prevent High Blood Pressure': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nMore than 1 in 3 adults in the U.S. has high blood pressure, or hypertension. Many of those people don't know they have it, because there are usually no warning signs. This can be dangerous, because high blood pressure can lead to life-threatening conditions like heart attack or stroke. The good news is that you can often prevent or treat high blood pressure. Early diagnosis and heart-healthy lifestyle changes can keep high blood pressure from seriously damaging your health.\\nWhat is blood pressure?\\nBlood pressure is the force of your blood pushing against the walls of your arteries. Each time your heart beats, it pumps blood into the arteries. Your blood pressure is highest when your heart beats, pumping the blood. This is called systolic pressure. When your heart is at rest, between beats, your blood pressure falls. This is called diastolic pressure.\\nYour blood pressure reading uses these two numbers. Usually the systolic number comes before or above the diastolic number. For example, 120/80 means a systolic of 120 and a diastolic of 80.\\nHow is high blood pressure diagnosed?\\nHigh blood pressure usually has no symptoms. So the only way to find out if you have it is to get regular blood pressure checks from your health care provider. Your provider will use a gauge, a stethoscope or electronic sensor, and a blood pressure cuff. He or she will take two or more readings at separate appointments before making a diagnosis.\\n\\n\\n\\nBlood Pressure Category\\nSystolic Blood Pressure\\n\\nDiastolic Blood Pressure\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNormal\\nLess than 120\\nand\\nLess than 80\\n\\n\\nHigh Blood Pressure (no other heart risk factors)\\n140 or higher\\nor\\n90 or higher\\n\\n\\nHigh Blood Pressure (with other heart risk factors, according to some providers)\\n130 or higher\\nor\\n80 or higher\\n\\n\\nDangerously high blood pressure - seek medical care right away\\n180 or higher\\nand\\n120 or higher\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFor children and teens, the health care provider compares the blood pressure reading to what is normal for other kids who are the same age, height, and gender.\\nPeople with diabetes or chronic kidney disease should keep their blood pressure below 130/80.\\nWho is at risk for high blood pressure?\\nAnyone can develop high blood pressure, but there are certain factors that can increase your risk:\\nAge - Blood pressure tends to rise with age\\nRace/Ethnicity - High blood pressure is more common in African American adults\\nWeight - People who are overweight or have obesity are more likely to develop high blood pressure\\nSex - Before age 55, men are more likely than women to develop high blood pressure. After age 55, women are more likely than men to develop it.\\nLifestyle - Certain lifestyle habits can raise your risk for high blood pressure, such as eating too much sodium (salt) or not enough potassium, lack of exercise, drinking too much alcohol, and smoking.\\nFamily history - A family history of high blood pressure raises the risk of developing high blood pressure\\n\\nHow can I prevent high blood pressure?\\nYou can help prevent high blood pressure by having a healthy lifestyle. This means:\\nEating a healthy diet. To help manage your blood pressure, you should limit the amount of sodium (salt) that you eat and increase the amount of potassium in your diet. It is also important to eat foods that are lower in fat, as well as plenty of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. The DASH eating plan is an example of an eating plan that can help you to lower your blood pressure.\\nGetting regular exercise. Exercise can help you maintain a healthy weight and lower your blood pressure. You should try to get moderate-intensity aerobic exercise at least 2 and a half hours per week, or vigorous-intensity aerobic exercise for 1 hour and 15 minutes per week. Aerobic exercise, such as brisk walking, is any exercise in which your heart beats harder and you use more oxygen than usual.\\nBeing at a healthy weight. Being overweight or having obesity increases your risk for high blood pressure. Maintaining a healthy weight can help you control high blood pressure and reduce your risk for other health problems.\\nLimiting alcohol. Drinking too much alcohol can raise your blood pressure. It also adds extra calories, which may cause weight gain. Men should have no more than two drinks per day, and women only one.\\nNot smoking. Cigarette smoking raises your blood pressure and puts you at higher risk for heart attack and stroke. If you do not smoke, do not start. If you do smoke, talk to your health care provider for help in finding the best way for you to quit.\\nManaging stress. Learning how to relax and manage stress can improve your emotional and physical health and lower high blood pressure. Stress management techniques include exercising, listening to music, focusing on something calm or peaceful, and meditating.\\n\\nIf you already have high blood pressure, it is important to prevent it from getting worse or causing complications. You should get regular medical care and follow your prescribed treatment plan. Your plan will include healthy lifestyle habit recommendations and possibly medicines.\\nNIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute\\n\",\n",

       " 'Guide to Good Posture': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nGood posture is about more than standing up straight so you can look your best. It is an important part of your long-term health. Making sure that you hold your body the right way, whether you are moving or still, can prevent pain, injuries, and other health problems.\\nWhat is posture?\\nPosture is how you hold your body. There are two types:\\nDynamic posture is how you hold yourself when you are moving, like when you are walking, running, or bending over to pick up something.\\nStatic posture is how you hold yourself when you are not moving, like when you are sitting, standing, or sleeping.\\n\\nIt is important to make sure that you have good dynamic and static posture.\\nThe key to good posture is the position of your spine. Your spine has three natural curves - at your neck, mid back, and low back. Correct posture should maintain these curves, but not increase them. Your head should be above your shoulders, and the top of your shoulder should be over the hips.\\nHow can posture affect my health?\\nPoor posture can be bad for your health. Slouching or slumping over can:\\nMisalign your musculoskeletal system\\nWear away at your spine, making it more fragile and prone to injury\\nCause neck, shoulder, and back pain\\nDecrease your flexibility\\nAffect how well your joints move\\nAffect your balance and increase your risk of falling\\nMake it harder to digest your food\\nMake it harder to breathe\\n\\nHow can I improve my posture in general?\\n\\n\\nBe mindful of your posture during everyday activities, like watching television, washing dishes, or walking\\nStay active. Any kind of exercise may help improve your posture, but certain types of exercises can be especially helpful. They include yoga, tai chi, and other classes that focuses on body awareness. It is also a good idea to do exercises that strengthen your core (muscles around your back, abdomen, and pelvis).\\nMaintain a healthy weight. Extra weight can weaken your abdominal muscles, cause problems for your pelvis and spine, and contribute to low back pain. All of these can hurt your posture.\\nWear comfortable, low-heeled shoes. High heels, for example, can throw off your balance and force you to walk differently. This puts more stress on your muscles and harms your posture.\\nMake sure work surfaces are at a comfortable height for you, whether you're sitting in front of a computer, making dinner, or eating a meal.\\n\\nHow can I improve my posture when sitting?\\nMany Americans spend a lot of their time sitting - either at work, at school, or at home. It is important to sit properly, and to take frequent breaks:\\nSwitch sitting positions often\\nTake brief walks around your office or home\\nGently stretch your muscles every so often to help relieve muscle tension\\nDon't cross your legs; keep your feet on the floor, with your ankles in front of your knees\\nMake sure that your feet touch the floor, or if that's not possible, use a footrest\\nRelax your shoulders; they should not be rounded or pulled backwards\\nKeep your elbows in close to your body. They should be bent between 90 and 120 degrees.\\nMake sure that your back is fully supported. Use a back pillow or other back support if your chair does not have a backrest that can support your lower back's curve.\\nMake sure that your thighs and hips are supported. You should have a well-padded seat, and your thighs and hips should be parallel to the floor.\\n \\nHow can I improve my posture when standing?\\n\\n\\nStand up straight and tall\\nKeep your shoulders back\\nPull your stomach in\\nPut your weight mostly on the balls of your feet\\nKeep your head level\\nLet your arms hang down naturally at your sides\\nKeep your feet about shoulder-width apart\\n \\nWith practice, you can improve your posture; you will look and feel better.\\n\",\n",

The first is an involuntary movement of your diaphragm. The diaphragm is a muscle at the base of your lungs. It is the main muscle used for breathing. The second part of a hiccup is a quick closing of your vocal cords. This is what causes the \"hic\" sound you make.\\nWhat causes hiccups?\\nHiccups can start and stop for no obvious reason. But they often happen when something irritates your diaphragm, such as:\\nEating too quickly\\nEating too much\\nEating hot or spicy foods\\nDrinking alcohol\\nDrinking carbonated drinks\\nDiseases that irritate the nerves that control the diaphragm\\nFeeling nervous or excited\\nA bloated stomach\\nCertain medicines\\nAbdominal surgery\\nMetabolic disorders\\nCentral nervous system disorders\\n\\nHow can I get rid of hiccups?\\nHiccups usually go away on their own after a few minutes. You have probably heard different suggestions about how to cure hiccups. There is no proof that they work, but they are not harmful, so you could try them. They include:\\nBreathing into a paper bag\\nDrinking or sipping a glass of cold water\\nHolding your breath\\nGargling with ice water\\n\\nWhat are the treatments for chronic hiccups?\\nSome people have chronic hiccups. This means that the hiccups last more than a few days or keep coming back. Chronic hiccups can interfere with your sleep, eating, drinking, and talking.

It usually starts in the late fall and early winter and goes away during the spring and summer. Some people do have episodes of depression that start in the spring or summer, but that is a lot less common. Symptoms of SAD may include:\\nSadness\\nGloomy outlook\\nFeeling hopeless, worthless, and irritable\\nLoss of interest or pleasure in activities you used to enjoy\\nLow energy\\nDifficulty sleeping or oversleeping\\nCarbohydrate cravings and weight gain\\nThoughts of death or suicide\\n\\nSAD is more common in women, young people, and those who live far from the equator. You are also more likely to have SAD if you or your family members have depression.\\nThe exact causes of SAD are unknown. Researchers have found that people with SAD may have an imbalance of serotonin, a brain chemical that affects your mood. Their bodies also make too much melatonin, a hormone that regulates sleep, and not enough vitamin D.\\nThe main treatment for SAD is light therapy. The idea behind light therapy is to replace the sunshine that you miss during the fall and winter months. You sit in front of a light therapy box every morning to get daily exposure to bright, artificial light. But some people with SAD do not respond to light therapy alone. Antidepressant medicines and talk therapy can reduce SAD symptoms, either alone or combined with light therapy.\\nNIH: National Institute of Mental Health\\n',\n",

It happens because of damage to nerve cells in the brain. PSP affects your movement, including control of your walking and balance. It also affects your thinking and eye movement.\\nPSP is progressive, which means that it gets worse over time.\\nWhat causes progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP)?\\nThe cause of PSP is unknown. In rare cases, the cause is a mutation in a certain gene.\\nOne sign of PSP is abnormal clumps of tau in nerve cells in the brain. Tau is a protein in your nervous system, including in nerve cells. Some other diseases also cause a buildup of tau in the brain, including Alzheimer's disease.\\nWho is at risk for progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP)?\\nPSP usually affects people over 60, but in some cases it can start earlier. It is more common in men.\\nWhat are the symptoms of progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP)?\\nSymptoms are very different in each person, but they may include:\\nA loss of balance while walking. This is often the first symptom.\\nSpeech problems\\nTrouble swallowing\\nA blurring of vision and problems controlling eye movement\\nChanges in mood and behavior, including depression and apathy (a loss of interest and enthusiasm)\\nMild dementia\\n\\nHow is progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP0 diagnosed?\\nThere is no specific test for PSP. It can be difficult to diagnose, because the symptoms are similar to other diseases such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease.\\nTo make a diagnosis, your health care provider will take your medical history and do physical and neurological exams. You may have an MRI or other imaging tests.\\nWhat are the treatments for progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP)?\\nThere is currently no effective treatment for PSP. Medicines may reduce some symptoms. Some non-drug treatments, such as walking aids and special glasses, may also help. People with severe swallowing problems may need gastrostomy.

       " 'Baby Health Checkup': '\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nThere are many new responsibilities when you have a baby. One of them is to make sure that your baby gets regular checkups, which are called well-baby exams. These exams are important in making sure that your baby is growing and developing properly. If there are problems, you can catch them early. This means that there is a better chance for treatment.\\nDuring these checkups, your baby will get any needed vaccines and screenings.  This is also a good chance to ask your health care provider any questions about how to care for your baby. The provider will let you know how often your baby should get these checkups.\\n',\n",
       " 'HDL: The \"Good\" Cholesterol': '\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nWhat is cholesterol?\\nCholesterol is a waxy, fat-like substance that\\'s found in all the cells in your body. Your liver makes cholesterol, and it is also in some foods, such as meat and dairy products. Your body needs some cholesterol to work properly. But having too much cholesterol in your blood raises your risk of coronary artery disease.\\nWhat are HDL and LDL?\\nHDL and LDL are two types of lipoproteins.They are a combination of fat (lipid) and protein.  The lipids need to be attached to the proteins so they can move through the blood. HDL and LDL have different purposes:\\nHDL stands for high-density lipoproteins. It is sometimes called the \"good\" cholesterol because it carries cholesterol from other parts of your body back to your liver. Your liver then removes the cholesterol from your body.\\nLDL stands for low-density lipoproteins. It is sometimes called the \"bad\" cholesterol because a high LDL level leads to a buildup of cholesterol in your arteries.\\n\\nHow do I know what my HDL level is?\\nA blood test can measure your cholesterol levels, including HDL. When and how often you should get this test depends on your age, risk factors, and family history.  The general recommendations are:\\nFor people who are age 19 or younger::\\nThe first test should be between ages 9 to 11\\nChildren should have the test again every 5 years\\nSome children may have this test starting at age 2 if there is a family history of high blood cholesterol, heart attack, or stroke\\n\\nFor people who are age 20 or older::\\nYounger adults should have the test every 5 years\\nMen ages 45 to 65 and women ages 55 to 65 should have it every 1 to 2 years\\n\\nWhat should my HDL level be?\\n With HDL cholesterol, higher numbers are better, because a high HDL level can lower your risk for coronary artery disease and stroke. How high your HDL should be depends on your age and sex:\\n\\n\\n\\nGroup\\nHealthy HDL Level\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAge 19 or younger\\nMore than 45mg/dl\\n\\n\\nMen age 20 or older\\nMore than 40mg/dl\\n\\n\\nWomen age 20 or older\\nMore than 50mg/dl\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHow can I raise my HDL level?\\nIf your HDL level is too low, lifestyle changes may help. These changes may also help prevent other diseases, and make you feel better overall:\\nEat a healthy diet. To raise your HDL level, you need to eat good fats instead of bad fats. This means limiting saturated fats, which include full-fat milk and cheese, high-fat meats like sausage and bacon, and foods made with butter, lard, and shortening. You should also avoid trans fats, which may be in some margarines, fried foods, and processed foods like baked goods. Instead, eat unsaturated fats, which are found in avocado, vegetable oils like olive oil, and nuts. Limit carbohydrates, especially sugar. Also try to eat more foods naturally high in fiber, such as oatmeal and beans.\\nStay at a healthy weight. You can boost your HDL level by losing weight, especially if you have lots of fat around your waist.\\nExercise. Getting regular exercise can raise your HDL level, as well as lower your LDL. You should try to do 30 minutes of moderate to vigorous aerobic exercise on most, if not all, days.\\nAvoid cigarettes. Smoking and exposure to secondhand smoke can lower your HDL level. If you are a smoker, ask your health care provider for help in finding the best way for you to quit. You should also try to avoid secondhand smoke.\\nLimit alcohol. Moderate alcohol may lower your HDL level, although more studies are needed to confirm that. What we do know is that too much alcohol can make you gain weight, and that lowers your HDL level.\\n\\nSome cholesterol medicines, including certain statins, can raise your HDL level, in addition to lowering your LDL level. Health care providers don\\'t usually prescribe medicines only to raise HDL. But if you have a low HDL and high LDL level, you might need medicine.\\nWhat else can affect my HDL level?\\nTaking certain medicines can lower HDL levels in some people. They include:\\nBeta blockers, a type of blood pressure medicine\\nAnabolic steroids, including testosterone, a male hormone\\nProgestins, which are female hormones that are in some birth control pills and hormone replacement therapy\\nBenzodiazepines, sedatives that are often used for anxiety and insomnia\\n\\nIf you are taking one of these and you have a very low HDL level, ask your provider if you should continue to take them.\\nDiabetes can also lower your HDL level, so that gives you another reason to manage your diabetes.\\n',\n",
       " \"Crohn's Disease\": \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nWhat is Crohn's disease?\\nCrohn's disease is a chronic disease that causes inflammation in your digestive tract. It can affect any part of your digestive tract, which runs from your mouth to your anus. But it usually affects your small intestine and the beginning of your large intestine.\\nCrohn's disease is an inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Ulcerative colitis and microscopic colitis are other common types of IBD.\\nWhat causes Crohn's disease?\\nThe cause of Crohn's disease is unknown. Researchers think that an autoimmune reaction may be one cause. An autoimmune reaction happens when your immune system attacks healthy cells in your body. Genetics may also play a role, since Crohn's disease can run in families.\\nStress and eating certain foods don't cause the disease, but they can make your symptoms worse.\\nWho is at risk for Crohn's disease?\\nThere are certain factors which can raise your risk of Crohn's disease:\\nFamily history of the disease. Having a parent, child, or sibling with the disease puts you at higher risk.\\nSmoking. This may double your risk of developing Crohn's disease.\\nCertain medicines, such as antibiotics, birth-control pills, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as aspirin or ibuprofen. These may slightly increase your chance of developing Crohn's.\\nA high-fat diet. This may also slightly increase your risk of Crohn's.\\n\\nWhat are the symptoms of Crohn's disease?\\nThe symptoms of Crohn's disease can vary, depending where and how severe your inflammation is. The most common symptoms include:\\nDiarrhea\\nCramping and pain in your abdomen\\nWeight loss\\n\\nSome other possible symptoms are:\\nAnemia, a condition in which you have fewer red blood cells than normal\\nEye redness or pain\\nFatigue\\nFever\\nJoint pain or soreness\\nNausea or loss of appetite\\nSkin changes that involve red, tender bumps under the skin\\n\\nStress and eating certain foods such as carbonated drinks and high-fiber foods may make some people's symptoms worse.\\nWhat other problems can Crohn's disease cause?\\nCrohn's disease can cause other problems, including:\\nIntestinal obstruction, a blockage in the intestine\\nFistulas, abnormal connections between two parts inside of the body\\nAbscesses, pus-filled pockets of infection\\nAnal fissures, small tears in your anus that may cause itching, pain, or bleeding\\nUlcers, open sores in your mouth, intestines, anus, or perineum\\nMalnutrition, when your body does not get the right amount of vitamins, minerals, and nutrients it needs\\nInflammation in other areas of your body, such as your joints, eyes, and skin\\n\\nHow is Crohn's disease diagnosed?\\nYour health care provider may use many tools to make a diagnosis:\\nA medical history, which includes asking about your symptoms\\nA family history\\nA physical exam, including\\n\\t\\nChecking for bloating in your abdomen\\nListening to sounds within your abdomen using a stethoscope\\nTapping on your abdomen to check for tenderness and pain and to see if your liver or spleen is abnormal or enlarged\\n\\n\\nVarious tests, including\\n\\t\\nBlood and stool tests\\nA colonoscopy\\nAn upper GI endoscopy, a procedure in which your provider uses a scope to look inside your mouth, esophagus, stomach, and small intestine\\nDiagnostic imaging tests, such as a CT scan or an upper GI series. An upper GI series uses a special liquid called barium and x-rays. Drinking the barium will make your upper GI tract more visible on an x-ray.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat are the treatments for Crohn's disease?\\nThere is no cure for Crohn's disease, but treatments can decrease the inflammation in your intestines, relieve symptoms, and prevent complications. Treatments include medicines, bowel rest, and surgery. No single treatment works for everyone. You and your health care provider can work together to figure out which treatment is best for you:\\nMedicines for Crohn's include various medicines that decrease the inflammation. Some of these medicines do this by reducing the activity of your immune system. Medicines can also help with symptoms or complications, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and anti-diarrheal medicines. If your Crohn's causes an infection, you may need antibiotics.\\nBowel rest involves drinking only certain liquids or not eating or drinking anything. This allows your intestines to rest. You may need to do this if your Crohn's disease symptoms are severe. You get your nutrients through drinking a liquid, a feeding tube, or an intravenous (IV) tube. You may need to do bowel rest in the hospital, or you may be able to do it at home. It will last for a few days or up to several weeks.\\nSurgery can treat complications and reduce symptoms when other treatments are not helping enough. The surgery will involve removing a damaged part of your digestive tract to treat\\n\\t\\nFistulas\\nBleeding that is life threatening\\nIntestinal obstructions\\nSide effects from medicines when they threaten your health\\nSymptoms when medicines do not improve your condition\\n\\n\\n\\nChanging your diet can help reduce symptoms. Your provider may recommend that you make changes to your diet, such as:\\nAvoiding carbonated drinks\\nAvoiding popcorn, vegetable skins, nuts, and other high-fiber foods\\nDrinking more liquids\\nEating smaller meals more often\\nKeeping a food diary to help identify foods that cause problems\\n\\nSome people also need go on special diet, such as a low-fiber diet.\\nNational Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases\\n\",\n",
       " 'Fibromyalgia': '\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nWhat is fibromyalgia?\\nFibromyalgia is chronic condition that causes pain all over the body, fatigue, and other symptoms. People with fibromyalgia may be more sensitive to pain than people who don\\'t have it. This is called abnormal pain perception processing.\\nWhat causes fibromyalgia?\\nThe exact cause of fibromyalgia is unknown. Researchers think that certain things might contribute to its cause:\\nStressful or traumatic events, such as car accidents\\nRepetitive injuries\\nIllnesses such as viral infections\\n\\nSometimes, fibromyalgia can develop on its own. It can run in families, so genes may play a role in the cause.\\nWho is at risk for fibromyalgia?\\nAnyone can get fibromyalgia, but it is more common in:\\nWomen; they are twice as likely to have fibromyalgia\\nMiddle-aged people\\nPeople with certain diseases, such as lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, or ankylosing spondylitis\\nPeople who have a family member with fibromyalgia\\n\\nWhat are the symptoms of fibromyalgia?\\nCommon symptoms of fibromyalgia include:\\nPain and stiffness all over the body\\nFatigue and tiredness\\nProblems with thinking, memory, and concentration (sometimes called \"fibro fog\")\\nDepression and anxiety\\nHeadaches, including migraines\\nIrritable bowel syndrome\\nNumbness or tingling in the hands and feet\\nPain in the face or jaw, including disorders of the jaw know as temporomandibular joint syndrome (TMJ)\\nSleep problems\\n\\nHow is fibromyalgia diagnosed?\\nFibromyalgia can be hard to diagnose. It sometimes takes visits to several different health care providers to get a diagnosis. One problem is that there isn\\'t a specific test for it. And the main symptoms, pain and fatigue, are common in many other conditions. Health care providers have to rule out other causes of the symptoms before making a diagnosis of fibromyalgia. This is called making a differential diagnosis.\\nTYour health care provider may use many tools to make a diagnosis:\\nA medical history, including asking detailed questions about your symptoms\\nA physical exam\\nX-rays and blood tests to rule out other conditions\\nThe guidelines for diagnosing fibromyalgia, which include\\n\\nA history of widespread pain lasting more than 3 months\\nPhysical symptoms including fatigue, waking unrefreshed, and cognitive (memory or thought) problems\\nThe number of areas throughout the body in which you had pain in the past week\\n\\n\\nWhat are the treatments for fibromyalgia?\\nNot all health care providers are familiar with fibromyalgia and its treatment. You should see a doctor or team of health care providers who specialize in the treatment of fibromyalgia.\\nFibromyalgia is treated with a combination of treatments, which may include medicines, lifestyle changes, talk therapy, and complementary therapies:\\nMedicines\\n\\nOver-the-counter pain relievers\\nPrescription medicines that were specifically approved to treat fibromyalgia\\nPrescription pain medicines\\nCertain antidepressants, which may help with pain or sleep problems\\n\\nLifestyle changes\\n\\nGetting enough sleep\\nGetting regular physical activity. If you have not already been active, start slowly and gradually increase how much activity you get. You may want to see a physical therapist, who can help you create a plan that is right for you.\\nLearning how to manage stress\\nEating a healthy diet\\nLearning to pace yourself. If you do too much, it can make your symptoms worse. So you need to learn to balance being active with your need for rest.\\n\\nTalk therapy, such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), can help you learn strategies to deal with pain, stress, and negative thoughts. If you also have depression along with your fibromyalgia, talk therapy can help with that too.\\nComplementary therapies have helped some people with the symptoms of fibromyalgia. But researchers need to do more studies to show which ones are effective. You could consider trying them, but you should check with your health care provider first. These therapies include\\n\\nMassage therapy\\nMovement therapies\\nChiropractic therapy\\nAcupuncture\\n\\n\\n',\n",
       " 'Pneumocystis Infections': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nPneumocystis jirovecii is a tiny fungus that lives in the lungs of many people. Most people's immune systems keep the fungus under control. But if you have a weakened immune system, the fungus can make you very sick.\\nThe most common type of infection is pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP). PCP once was the major cause of death for people with HIV/AIDS. But now, it is possible to prevent or treat most cases.  The key to surviving PCP is early treatment. The first signs of PCP are fever, dry cough, shortness of breath, and fatigue. If you have a weakened immune system and have these symptoms, see your doctor right away.\\nTo diagnose PCP, doctors use a microscope to look for the fungus in a sample of lung fluid or tissue. Treatment is with antibiotics.\\nThere is no vaccine to prevent PCP. Some people who are at high risk of getting PCP may need to take antibiotics to prevent it.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Hemophilia': '\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nWhat is hemophilia?\\nHemophilia is a rare bleeding disorder in which the blood does not clot properly. This can lead to problems with bleeding too much after an injury or surgery. You can also have sudden bleeding inside your body, such as in your joints, muscles, and organs.\\nYour blood contains many proteins called clotting factors that can help form clots to stop bleeding. People with hemophilia have low levels of one of these factors, usually either factor VIII (8) or factor IX (9). How severe the hemophilia is depends on the amount of factor in the blood. The lower the amount of the factor, the more likely it is that bleeding could happen and might lead to serious health problems.\\nWhat are the types of hemophilia?\\nThere are several different types of hemophilia. The most common are:\\n\\nHemophilia A (classic hemophilia), which is caused by a lack or decrease of clotting factor VIII (8)\\nHemophilia B (Christmas disease), which is caused by a lack or decrease of clotting factor IX (9)\\n\\nWhat causes hemophilia?\\nMost types of hemophilia are inherited. They are caused by change in one of the genes (also called a mutation) that provides instructions for making the clotting factor proteins. The change may mean that the clotting proteins don\\'t work properly or that they are missing altogether.\\nThese genes are on the X chromosome. You may have one or two X chromosomes:\\n\\nPeople who are born male have one X chromosome (from the mother) and one Y chromosome (from the father). They can get hemophilia if their one X chromosome has the gene change.\\nPeople who are born female have two X chromosomes, one from the father and one from the mother. They usually only get hemophilia if:\\n\\t\\nBoth X chromosomes have the gene change OR\\nOne X chromosome has the gene change and the other X chromosome is missing or inactive.\\n\\nPeople who are born female who have the gene change on one X chromosome are a \"carrier\" of hemophilia. Sometimes they may have some symptoms of hemophilia. They can pass the gene change on to their children.\\n\\n\\nHemophilia that is not inherited is called acquired hemophilia. It is rare. It happens when your body makes specialized proteins called autoantibodies that attack and disable a clotting factor. This can happen because of pregnancy, immune system disorders, cancer, or allergic reactions to certain medicines. Sometimes the cause is unknown.\\nWho is at risk for hemophilia?\\nHemophilia is much more common in people who were born male since they can get it with a change to the gene on one X chromosome. People who have a family history of hemophilia are also at higher risk.\\nWhat are the symptoms of hemophilia?\\nThe signs and symptoms of hemophilia are:\\n\\nBleeding into the joints. This can cause swelling and pain or tightness in the joints. It often affects the knees, elbows, and ankles.\\nBleeding into the skin (which is bruising).\\nBleeding into the muscle and soft tissue, which can cause a build-up of blood in the area (called a hematoma).\\nBleeding of the mouth and gums, including bleeding that is hard to stop after you lose a tooth.\\nBleeding after circumcision.\\nBleeding after having shots, such as vaccinations.\\nBleeding in the head of an infant after a difficult delivery.\\nBlood in the urine or stool.\\nFrequent and hard-to-stop nosebleeds.\\n\\nIn some cases, severe hemophilia may cause bleeding in the brain. This may cause brain damage and can be life-threatening.\\nHow is hemophilia diagnosed?\\nTo find out if you have hemophilia, your health care provider will:\\n\\nAsk about your medical history, including your symptoms and other health conditions you may have.\\nAsk about your family history, to find out if you have relatives who have or had hemophilia.\\nDo a physical exam to look for signs of hemophilia, such as bruising.\\nDo certain blood tests to show if your blood is clotting properly. If it does not, then you will have clotting factor tests to diagnose the cause of the bleeding disorder. These blood tests would show the type of hemophilia and the severity.\\n\\nThere is genetic testing for the factor VIII (8) and factor IX (9) genes. This testing may be used in people who have a family history of hemophilia to:\\n\\nIdentify people who are carriers before they make decisions about pregnancy\\nTest a fetus for hemophilia during pregnancy\\nTest a newborn for hemophilia\\n\\nWhat are the treatments for hemophilia?\\nThe best way to treat hemophilia is to replace the missing clotting factor so that your blood can clot properly. This is usually done by injecting replacement clotting factor into a vein. The replacement clotting factor may be made from donated human blood. Or it may be made in a lab; this kind is called a recombinant clotting factor.\\nReplacement clotting factor can help treat a bleeding episode. In more severe cases of hemophilia, you might get the factor on a regular basis to prevent bleeding. You can learn how to inject the factor so that you can do it yourself at home.\\nThere are other medicines to treat hemophilia. They may work by releasing factor VIII (8) from where it is stored in the body tissues, replacing the function of factor VIII (8), or preventing clots from breaking down.\\nIf bleeding has damaged your joints, physical therapy may help them function better.\\nGood quality medical care from healthcare professionals who know a lot about the disorder can help prevent some serious problems. Often the best choice for care is to visit a hemophilia treatment center (HTC).\\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention\\n',\n",

       " 'Diabetes Type 2': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nWhat is type 2 diabetes?\\nType 2 diabetes is a disease in which your blood glucose, or blood sugar, levels are too high. Glucose is your main source of energy. It comes from the foods you eat. A hormone called insulin helps the glucose get into your cells to give them energy. If you have diabetes, your body doesn't make enough insulin or doesn't use insulin well. The glucose then stays in your blood and not enough goes into your cells.\\nOver time, having too much glucose in your blood can cause health problems. But you can take steps to manage your diabetes and try to prevent these health problems.\\nWhat causes type 2 diabetes?\\nType 2 diabetes may be caused by a combination of factors:\\nBeing overweight or having obesity\\nNot being physically active\\nGenetics and family history\\n\\nType 2 diabetes usually starts with insulin resistance. This is a condition in which your cells don't respond normally to insulin. As a result, your body needs more insulin to help the glucose enter your cells. At first, your body makes more insulin to try to get cells to respond. But over time, your body can't make enough insulin, and your blood glucose levels rise.\\nWho is at risk for type 2 diabetes?\\nYou are at higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes if you:\\nAre over age 45. Children, teenagers, and younger adults can get type 2 diabetes, but it is more common in middle-aged and older people.\\nHave prediabetes, which means that your blood sugar is higher than normal but not high enough to be called diabetes\\nHad diabetes in pregnancy or gave birth to a baby weighing 9 pounds or more.\\nHave a family history of diabetes\\nAre overweight or have obesity\\nAre Black or African American, Hispanic/Latino, American Indian, Asian American, or Pacific Islander\\nAre not physically active\\nHave other conditions such as high blood pressure, heart disease, stroke, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), or depression\\nHave low HDL (good) cholesterol and high triglycerides\\nHave acanthosis nigricans - dark, thick, and velvety skin around your neck or armpits\\n\\nWhat are the symptoms of type 2 diabetes?\\nMany people with type 2 diabetes have no symptoms at all. If you do have them, the symptoms develop slowly over several years. They might be so mild that you do not notice them. The symptoms can include:\\nIncreased thirst and urination\\nIncreased hunger\\nFeeling tired\\nBlurred vision\\nNumbness or tingling in the feet or hands\\nSores that do not heal\\nUnexplained weight loss\\n\\nHow is type 2 diabetes diagnosed?\\nYour health care provider will use blood tests to diagnose type 2 diabetes. The blood tests include:\\nA1C test, which measures your average blood sugar level over the past 3 months\\nFasting plasma glucose (FPG) test, which measures your current blood sugar level. You need to fast (not eat or drink anything except water) for at least 8 hours before the test.\\nRandom plasma glucose (RPG) test, which measures your current blood sugar level. This test is used when you have diabetes symptoms and the provider does not want to wait for you to fast before having the test.\\n\\nWhat are the treatments for type 2 diabetes?\\nTreatment for type 2 diabetes involves managing your blood sugar levels. Many people are able to do this by living a healthy lifestyle. Some people may also need to take medicine.:\\nA healthy lifestyle includes following a healthy eating plan and getting regular physical activity. You need to learn how to balance what you eat and drink with physical activity and diabetes medicine, if you take any.\\nMedicines for diabetes include oral medicines, insulin, and other injectable medicines. Over time, some people will need to take more than one type of medicine to control their diabetes.\\nYou will need to check your blood sugar regularly. Your health care provider will tell you how often you need to do it.\\nIt's also important to keep your blood pressure and cholesterol levels close to the targets your provider sets for you. Make sure to get your screening tests regularly.\\n\\nCan type 2 diabetes be prevented?\\nYou can take steps to help prevent or delay type 2 diabetes by losing weight if you are overweight, eating fewer calories, and being more physically active.

It usually starts before age 40.  \\nThe white patches are more common where your skin is exposed to the sun. In some cases, the patches spread. Vitiligo can cause your hair to gray early. If you have dark skin, you may lose color inside your mouth.  \\nUsing sunscreen will help protect your skin, and cosmetics can cover up the patches. Treatments for vitiligo include medicines, light therapy, and surgery. Not every treatment is right for everyone. Many have side effects. Some take a long time. Some do not always work.  \\nNIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases\\n',\n",
       " 'Pelvic Inflammatory Disease': '\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nPelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is an infection and inflammation of the uterus, ovaries, and other female reproductive organs. It causes scarring in these organs. This can lead to infertility, ectopic pregnancy, pelvic pain, abscesses, and other serious problems. PID is the most common preventable cause of infertility in the United States.\\nGonorrhea and chlamydia, two sexually transmitted diseases, are the most common causes of PID. Other bacteria can also cause it. You are at greater risk if you:\\nAre sexually active and younger than 25\\nHave more than one sex partner\\nDouche\\n\\nSome women have no symptoms. Others have pain in the lower abdomen, fever, smelly vaginal discharge, irregular bleeding, and pain during intercourse or urination. Doctors diagnose PID with a physical exam, lab tests, and imaging tests. Antibiotics can cure PID.  Early treatment is important. Waiting too long increases the risk of infertility.\\n\\n',\n",
       " 'Spleen Diseases': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nYour spleen is an organ above your stomach and under your ribs on your left side. It is about as big as your fist. The spleen is part of your lymphatic system, which fights infection and keeps your body fluids in balance. It contains white blood cells that fight germs. Your spleen also helps control the amount of blood in your body, and destroys old and damaged cells. \\nCertain diseases might cause your spleen to swell. You can also damage or rupture your spleen in an injury, especially if it is already swollen. If your spleen is too damaged, you might need surgery to remove it. You can live without a spleen. Other organs, such as your liver, will take over some of the spleen's work. Without a spleen, however, your body will lose some of its ability to fight infections.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Poison Ivy, Oak, and Sumac': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nIf you spend time outdoors, chances are you have been bothered by poison ivy, poison oak or poison sumac at some point. Most people are sensitive to the plants' oily sap. The sap is in the root, stems, leaves and fruit of these plants. If it gets on your skin, it causes a blistering skin rash. The rash can range from mild to severe, depending on how much sap gets on your skin and how sensitive you are to it. Problems can also happen if the plants are burned. Airborne sap-coated soot can get into the eyes, nose, throat and respiratory system. \\nThe best way to avoid the rash is to learn what the plants look like and stay away from them. If you come into contact with the plants, wash your skin and clothing right away.  If you develop a rash, ask your pharmacist about over-the-counter medicines. For severe rashes, see your doctor. \\nNational Park Service\\n\",\n",
       " 'Mammography': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nWhat is a mammogram?\\nA mammogram is an x-ray picture of the breast. Health care providers use mammograms to look for early signs of breast cancer. There are two types of mammograms: screening mammograms and diagnostic mammograms.\\nWhat is a screening mammogram?\\nA screening mammogram is a mammogram usually done for women who have no signs or symptoms of breast cancer. Regular screening mammograms can help reduce the number of deaths from breast cancer among women ages 40 to 74. This is because they can find breast cancer early and treatment can start earlier, maybe before it has spread.\\nBut screening mammograms can also have risks. They can sometimes find something that looks abnormal but isn't cancer. This leads to further testing and can cause you anxiety. Sometimes mammograms can miss cancer when it is there. It also exposes you to radiation. You should talk to your provider about the benefits and drawbacks of mammograms. Together, you can decide when to start and how often to have a mammogram.\\nNot much is known about breast cancer risk in transgender people. If you are transgender, talk to your provider about your risk and whether you need screening mammograms.\\nWhat is a diagnostic mammogram?\\nA diagnostic mammogram is done for people who have a lump or other signs or symptoms of breast cancer. The signs can include breast pain, thickening of the skin of the breast, nipple discharge, or a change in breast size or shape. But these signs can also be caused by a breast condition that is benign (not cancer). A mammogram, along with other tests, can help your provider figure out whether you have cancer.\\nHow is a mammogram done?\\nWhen you have a mammogram, you stand in front of an x-ray machine. The person who takes the x-rays places your breast between two plastic plates. The plates press your breast and make it flat. This may be uncomfortable, but it helps get a clear picture.\\nYou will get both breasts x-rayed from the front and from the side. Afterwards, a radiologist (a doctor with special training) will read the mammogram. The doctor will look at the x-ray for early signs of breast cancer or other problems. You will usually get the results within a few weeks, although it depends on the clinic or medical office that you went to. If your results are not normal, you should hear back earlier. Contact your provider or the office where you had the mammogram if you do not receive a report of your results within 30 days.\\nWhat happens if my mammogram is not normal?\\nAn abnormal (not normal) mammogram does not always mean that there is cancer. You will need to have additional mammograms, tests, or exams before your provider can tell for sure. You may also be referred to a breast specialist or a surgeon. But it does not necessarily mean you have cancer or need surgery. You would see one of these doctors because they are experts in diagnosing breast problems. \\n\",\n",

       " 'Respiratory Failure': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nWhat is respiratory failure?\\nRespiratory failure is a condition in which your blood doesn't have enough oxygen or has too much carbon dioxide. Sometimes you can have both problems.\\nWhen you breathe, your lungs take in oxygen. The oxygen passes into your blood, which carries it to your organs. Your organs, such as your heart and brain, need this oxygen-rich blood to work well.\\nAnother part of breathing is removing the carbon dioxide from the blood and breathing it out. Having too much carbon dioxide in your blood can harm your organs.\\nWhat causes respiratory failure?\\nConditions that affect your breathing can cause respiratory failure. These conditions may affect the muscles, nerves, bones, or tissues that support breathing. Or they may affect the lungs directly. These conditions include:\\nDiseases that affect the lungs, such as COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), cystic fibrosis, pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, and COVID-19\\nConditions that affect the nerves and muscles that control breathing, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), muscular dystrophy, spinal cord injuries, and stroke\\nProblems with the spine, such as scoliosis (a curve in the spine). They can affect the bones and muscles used for breathing.\\nDamage to the tissues and ribs around the lungs. An injury to the chest can cause this damage.\\nDrug or alcohol overdose\\nInhalation injuries, such as from inhaling smoke (from fires) or harmful fumes\\n\\nWhat are the symptoms of respiratory failure?\\nThe symptoms of respiratory failure depend on the cause and the levels of oxygen and carbon dioxide in your blood.\\nA low oxygen level in the blood can cause shortness of breath and air hunger (the feeling that you can't breathe in enough air). Your skin, lips, and fingernails may also have a bluish color. A high carbon dioxide level can cause rapid breathing and confusion.\\nSome people who have respiratory failure may become very sleepy or lose consciousness. They also may have arrhythmia (irregular heartbeat). You may have these symptoms if your brain and heart are not getting enough oxygen.\\nHow is respiratory failure diagnosed?\\nYour health care provider will diagnose respiratory failure based on:\\nYour medical history\\nA physical exam, which often includes\\n\\nListening to your lungs to check for abnormal sounds\\nListening to your heart to check for arrhythmia\\nLooking for a bluish color on your skin, lips, and fingernails\\n\\nDiagnostic tests, such as\\n\\nPulse oximetry, a small sensor that uses a light to measure how much oxygen is in your blood. The sensor goes on the end of your finger or on your ear.\\nArterial blood gas test, a test that measures the oxygen and carbon dioxide levels in your blood. The blood sample is taken from an artery, usually in your wrist.\\n\\n\\nOnce you are diagnosed with respiratory failure, your provider will look for what is causing it. Tests for this often include a chest x-ray. If your provider thinks you may have arrhythmia because of the respiratory failure, you may have an EKG (electrocardiogram). This is simple, painless test that detects and records your heart's electrical activity.\\nWhat are the treatments for respiratory failure?\\nTreatment for respiratory failure depends on:\\nWhether it is acute (short-term) or chronic (ongoing)\\nHow severe it is\\nWhat is causing it\\n\\nAcute respiratory failure can be a medical emergency. You may need treatment in intensive care unit at a hospital. Chronic respiratory failure can often be treated at home. But if your chronic respiratory failure is severe, you might need treatment in a long-term care center.\\nOne of the main goals of treatment is to get oxygen to your lungs and other organs and remove carbon dioxide from your body. Another goal is to treat the cause of the condition. Treatments may include:\\nOxygen therapy, through a nasal cannula (two small plastic tubes that go in your nostrils) or through a mask that fits over your nose and mouth\\nTracheostomy, a surgically-made hole that goes through the front of your neck and into your windpipe. A breathing tube, also called a tracheostomy, or trach tube, is placed in the hole to help you breathe.\\nVentilator, a breathing machine that blows air into your lungs. It also carries carbon dioxide out of your lungs.\\nOther breathing treatments, such as noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV), which uses mild air pressure to keep your airways open while you sleep. Another treatment is a special bed that rocks back and forth, to help you breathe in and out.\\nFluids, often through an intravenous (IV), to improve blood flow throughout your body. They also provide nutrition.\\nMedicines for discomfort\\nTreatments for the cause of the respiratory failure. These treatments may include medicines and procedures.\\n\\nIf you have respiratory failure, see your health care provider for ongoing medical care. Your provider may suggest pulmonary rehabilitation.\\nIf your respiratory failure is chronic, make sure that you know when and where to get help for your symptoms. You need emergency care if you have severe symptoms, such as trouble catching your breath or talking. You should call your provider if you notice that your symptoms are worsening or if you have new signs and symptoms.\\nLiving with respiratory failure may cause fear, anxiety, depression, and stress. Talk therapy, medicines, and support groups can help you feel better.\\nNIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute\\n\",\n",

       " 'Pacemakers and Implantable Defibrillators': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nAn arrhythmia is any disorder of your heart rate or rhythm. It means that your heart beats too quickly, too slowly, or with an irregular pattern. Most arrhythmias result from problems in the electrical system of the heart. If your arrhythmia is serious, you may need a cardiac pacemaker or an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD).  They are devices that are implanted in your chest or abdomen.\\nA pacemaker helps control abnormal heart rhythms. It uses electrical pulses to prompt the heart to beat at a normal rate. It can speed up a slow heart rhythm, control a fast heart rhythm, and coordinate the chambers of the heart.\\nAn ICD monitors heart rhythms. If it senses dangerous rhythms, it delivers shocks. This treatment is called defibrillation. An ICD can help control life-threatening arrhythmias, especially those that can cause sudden cardiac arrest (SCA). Most new ICDs can act as both a pacemaker and a defibrillator. Many ICDs also record the heart's electrical patterns when there is an abnormal heartbeat. This can help the doctor plan future treatment.\\nGetting a pacemaker or ICD requires minor surgery. You usually need to stay in the hospital for a day or two, so your doctor can make sure that the device is working well. You will probably be back to your normal activities within a few days.\\n\",\n",

Your stool passes out of your body through the rectum and anus.  Another name for stool is feces.  It is made of what is left after your digestive system (stomach, small intestine, and colon) absorbs nutrients and fluids from what you eat and drink.\\nSometimes a bowel movement isn't normal.  Diarrhea happens when stool passes through the large intestine too quickly. Constipation occurs when stool passes through the large intestine too slowly.

       " 'Low Blood Pressure': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nYou've probably heard that high blood pressure is a problem. Sometimes blood pressure that is too low can also cause problems.\\nBlood pressure is the force of your blood pushing against the walls of your arteries. Each time your heart beats, it pumps out blood into the arteries. Your blood pressure is highest when your heart beats, pumping the blood. This is called systolic pressure. When your heart is at rest, between beats, your blood pressure falls. This is the diastolic pressure. Your blood pressure reading uses these two numbers. Usually they're written one above or before the other, such as 120/80. If your blood pressure reading is 90/60 or lower, you have low blood pressure. \\nSome people have low blood pressure all the time. They have no symptoms and their low readings are normal for them. In other people, blood pressure drops below normal because of a medical condition or certain medicines. Some people may have symptoms of low blood pressure when standing up too quickly.  Low blood pressure is a problem only if it causes dizziness, fainting or in extreme cases, shock. \\nNIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute\\n\",\n",

Your body can use this fuel right away, or it can store the energy in your body tissues. If you have a metabolic disorder, something goes wrong with this process.\\nLipid metabolism disorders, such as Gaucher disease and Tay-Sachs disease, involve lipids. Lipids are fats or fat-like substances. They include oils, fatty acids, waxes, and cholesterol. If you have one of these disorders, you may not have enough enzymes to break down lipids. Or the enzymes may not work properly and your body can't convert the fats into energy. They cause a harmful amount of lipids to build up in your body. Over time, that can damage your cells and tissues, especially in the brain, peripheral nervous system, liver, spleen, and bone marrow. Many of these disorders can be very serious, or sometimes even fatal.\\nThese disorders are inherited. Newborn babies get screened for some of them, using blood tests. If there is a family history of one of these disorders, parents can get genetic testing to see whether they carry the gene. Other genetic tests can tell whether the fetus has the disorder or carries the gene for the disorder.\\nEnzyme replacement therapies can help with a few of these disorders. For others, there is no treatment. Medicines, blood transfusions, and other procedures may help with complications.\\n\",\n",

It makes hormones that control the way the body uses energy. These hormones affect nearly every organ in your body and control many of your body's most important functions. For example, they affect your breathing, heart rate, weight, digestion, and moods. Without enough thyroid hormones, many of your body's functions slow down. But there are treatments that can help.\\nWhat causes hypothyroidism?\\nHypothyroidism has several causes. They include:\\nHashimoto's disease, an autoimmune disorder where your immune system attacks your thyroid. This is the most common cause.\\nThyroiditis, inflammation of the thyroid\\nCongenital hypothyroidism, hypothyroidism that is present at birth\\nSurgical removal of part or all of the thyroid\\nRadiation treatment of the thyroid\\nCertain medicines\\nIn rare cases, a pituitary disease or too much or too little iodine in your diet\\n\\nWho is at risk for hypothyroidism?\\nYou are at higher risk for hypothyroidism if you:\\nAre a woman\\nAre older than age 60\\nHave had a thyroid problem before, such as a goiter\\nHave had surgery to correct a thyroid problem\\nHave received radiation treatment to the thyroid, neck, or chest\\nHave a family history of thyroid disease\\nWere pregnant or had a baby in the past 6 months\\nHave Turner syndrome, a genetic disorder that affects females\\nHave pernicious anemia, in which the body cannot make enough healthy red blood cells because it does not have enough vitamin B12\\nHave Sjogren's syndrome, a disease that causes dry eyes and mouth\\nHave type 1 diabetes\\nHave rheumatoid arthritis, an autoimmune disease that affects the joints\\nHave lupus, a chronic autoimmune disease\\n\\nWhat are the symptoms of hypothyroidism?\\nThe symptoms of hypothyroidism can vary from person to person and may include:\\nFatigue\\nWeight gain\\nA puffy face\\nTrouble tolerating cold\\nJoint and muscle pain\\nConstipation\\nDry skin\\nDry, thinning hair\\nDecreased sweating\\nHeavy or irregular menstrual periods\\nFertility problems in women\\nDepression\\nSlowed heart rate\\nGoiter, an enlarged thyroid that may cause your neck to look swollen. Sometimes it can cause trouble with breathing or swallowing.\\n\\nBecause hypothyroidism develops slowly, many people don't notice symptoms of the disease for months or even years.\\nWhat other problems can hypothyroidism cause?\\nHypothyroidism can contribute to high cholesterol. In rare cases, untreated hypothyroidism can cause myxedema coma. This is a condition in which your body's functions slow down to the point that it becomes life-threatening.\\nDuring pregnancy, hypothyroidism can cause complications, such as premature birth, high blood pressure in pregnancy, and miscarriage. It can also slow the baby's growth and development.\\nHow is hypothyroidism diagnosed?\\nYour health care provider may use many tools to make a diagnosis:\\nA medical history, including asking about your symptoms\\nA physical exam\\nThyroid tests, such as\\n\\t\\t\\nTSH, T3, T4, and thyroid antibody  blood tests\\nImaging tests, such as a thyroid scan, ultrasound, or radioactive iodine uptake test. A radioactive iodine uptake test measures how much radioactive iodine your thyroid takes up from your blood after you swallow a small amount of it.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat are the treatments for hypothyroidism?\\nThe treatment for hypothyroidism is medicine to replace the hormone that your own thyroid can no longer make. About 6 to 8 weeks after you start taking the medicine, you will get a blood test to check your thyroid hormone level. Your health care provider will adjust your dose if needed. Each time your dose is adjusted, you'll have another blood test. Once you find the right dose, you will probably get a blood test in 6 months.

Researchers do not fully know why this happens. But when it does, the blood vessels become inflamed and can narrow or close off.\\nGenetics may play a role in Kawasaki disease. There may also be environmental factors, such as infections. It does not seem to be contagious. This means that it cannot be passed from one child to another.\\nWho is at risk for Kawasaki disease?\\nKawasaki disease usually affects children under the age of 5. But older children and adults can sometimes get it. It is more common in boys than girls. It can affect children of any race, but those with Asian or Pacific Islander descent are more likely to get it.\\nWhat are the symptoms of Kawasaki disease?\\nThe symptoms of Kawasaki disease may include:\\nHigh fever lasting at least five days\\nA rash, often on the back, chest, and groin\\nSwollen hands and feet\\nRedness of the lips, lining of the mouth, tongue, palms of the hand, and soles of the feet\\nPink eye\\nSwollen lymph nodes\\n\\nWhat other problems can Kawasaki disease cause?\\nSometimes Kawasaki disease can affect the walls of the coronary arteries.

It's important to try to have a positive outlook; some ways to do that include\\n\\t\\t\\nFinding balance between positive and negative emotions.  Staying positive doesn't mean that you never feel negative emotions, such as sadness or anger. You need to feel them so that you can move through difficult situations. They can help you to respond to a problem. But you don't want those emotions to take over. For example, it's not helpful to keep thinking about bad things that happened in the past or worry too much about the future.\\nTrying to hold on to the positive emotions when you have them\\nTaking a break from negative information. Know when to stop watching or reading the news. Use social media to reach out for support and feel connected to others but be careful. Don't fall for rumors, get into arguments, or negatively compare your life to others.\\n\\n\\nPracticing gratitude, which means being thankful for the good things in your life. It's helpful to do this every day, either by thinking about what you are grateful for or writing it down in a journal. These can be big things, such as the support you have from loved ones, or little things, such as enjoying a nice meal. It's important to allow yourself a moment to enjoy that you had the positive experience.  Practicing gratitude can help you to see your life differently. For example, when you are stressed, you may not notice that there are also moments when you have some positive emotions. Gratitude can help you to recognize them.\\nTaking care of your physical health, since your physical and mental health are connected. Some ways to take care of your physical health include\\n\\t\\t\\nBeing physically active. Exercise can reduce feelings of stress and depression and improve your mood.\\nGetting enough sleep.

       " 'Chronic Myeloid Leukemia': '\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nWhat is leukemia?\\nLeukemia is a term for cancers of the blood cells. Leukemia starts in blood-forming tissues such as the bone marrow. Your bone marrow makes the cells which will develop into white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. Each type of cell has a different job:\\nWhite blood cells help your body fight infection\\nRed blood cells deliver oxygen from your lungs to your tissues and organs\\nPlatelets help form clots to stop bleeding\\n\\nWhen you have leukemia, your bone marrow makes large numbers of abnormal cells. This problem most often happens with white blood cells. These abnormal cells build up in your bone marrow and blood. They crowd out the healthy blood cells and make it hard for your cells and blood to do their work.\\nWhat is chronic myeloid leukemia (CML)? \\nChronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a type of chronic leukemia. \"Chronic\" means that the leukemia usually gets worse slowly. In CML, the bone marrow makes abnormal granulocytes (a type of white blood cell). These abnormal cells are also called blasts. When the abnormal cells crowd out the healthy cells, it can lead to infection, anemia, and easy bleeding. The abnormal cells can also spread outside the blood to other parts of the body.\\nCML usually occurs in adults during or after middle age. It is rare in children.\\nWhat causes chronic myeloid leukemia (CML)?\\nMost people with CML have a genetic change called the Philadelphia chromosome. It\\'s called that because researchers in Philadelphia discovered it. People normally have 23 pairs of chromosomes in each cell. These chromosomes contain your DNA (genetic material). In CML, part of the DNA from one chromosome moves to another chromosome. It combines with some DNA there, which creates a new gene called BCR-ABL. This gene causes your bone marrow to make an abnormal protein. This protein allows the leukemia cells to grow out of control.\\nThe Philadelphia chromosome isn\\'t passed from parent to child. It happens during your lifetime. The cause is unknown.\\nWho is at risk for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML)?\\nIt is hard to predict who will get CML. There are a few factors that could raise your risk:\\nAge - your risk goes up as you get older\\nGender - CML is slightly more common in men\\nExposure to high-dose radiation\\n\\nWhat are the symptoms of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML)?\\nSometimes CML does not cause symptoms. If you do have symptoms, they can include:\\nFeeling very tired\\nWeight loss for no known reason\\nDrenching night sweats\\nFever\\nPain or a feeling of fullness below the ribs on the left side\\n\\nHow is chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) diagnosed?\\nYour health care provider may use many tools to diagnose CML:\\nA physical exam\\nA medical history\\nBlood tests, such as a complete blood count (CBC) with differential  and blood chemistry tests. Blood chemistry tests measure different substances in the blood, including electrolytes, fats, proteins, glucose (sugar), and enzymes. Specific blood chemistry tests include a basic metabolic panel (BMP), a comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), kidney function tests, liver function tests, and an electrolyte panel.\\nBone marrow tests. There are two main types - bone marrow aspiration and bone marrow biopsy. Both tests involve removing a sample of bone marrow and bone. The samples are sent to a lab for testing.\\nGenetic tests to look for gene and chromosome changes, including tests to look for the Philadelphia chromosome\\n\\nIf you are diagnosed with CML, you may have additional tests such as imaging tests to see whether the cancer has spread.\\nWhat are the phases of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML)?\\nCML has three phases. The phases are based on how much the CML has grown or spread:\\nChronic phase, where less than 10% of cells in the blood and bone marrow are blast cells (leukemia cells). Most people are diagnosed in this phase, and many do not have symptoms. Standard treatment usually helps in this phase.\\nAccelerated phase, 10% to 19% of the cells in the blood and bone marrow are blast cells. In this phase, people often have symptoms and standard treatment may not be as effective as in the chronic phase.\\nBlastic phase, where 20% or more of the cells in the blood or bone marrow are blast cells. The blast cells have spread to other tissues and organs. If you have tiredness, fever, and an enlarged spleen during the blastic phase, it is called a blast crisis. This phase is harder to treat.\\n\\nWhat are the treatments for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML)?\\nThere are several different treatments for CML:\\nTargeted therapy, which uses drugs or other substances that attack specific cancer cells with less harm to normal cells. For CML, the drugs are tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). They block tyrosine kinase, which is an enzyme that causes your bone marrow to make too many blasts.\\nChemotherapy\\nImmunotherapy\\nHigh-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant\\nDonor lymphocyte infusion (DLI). DLI is a treatment that may be used after a stem cell transplant. It involves giving you an infusion (into your bloodstream) of healthy lymphocytes from the stem cell transplant donor. Lymphocytes are a type of white blood cell. These donor lymphocytes may kill the remaining cancer cells.\\nSurgery to remove the spleen (splenectomy)\\n\\nWhich treatments you get will depend on which phase you are in, your age, your overall health, and other factors. When the signs and symptoms of CML are reduced or have disappeared, it is called remission. The CML may come back after remission, and you may need more treatment.\\nNIH: National Cancer Institute\\n',\n",
       " 'Aphasia': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nWhat is aphasia?\\nAphasia is a language disorder that makes it hard for you to read, write, and say what you mean to say. Sometimes it makes it hard to understand what other people are saying, too. Aphasia is not a disease. It's a symptom of damage to the parts of the brain that control language.\\nThe signs of aphasia depend on which part of the brain is damaged. There are four main types of aphasia:\\n\\nExpressive aphasia is when you know what you want to say, but you have trouble saying or writing your thoughts.\\nReceptive aphasia affects your ability to read and understand speech. You can hear what people say or see words on a page, but you have trouble making sense of what they mean.\\nGlobal aphasia is the loss of almost all language ability. You can't speak, understand speech, read, or write. \\nAnomic or amnesia aphasia is when you have trouble using the right words for certain things, people, places or events.\\n\\nIn some cases, aphasia may get better on its own. But it can be a long-term condition. There's no cure, but treatment may help improve language skills.\\nWhat causes aphasia?\\nAphasia happens from damage to one or more parts of the brain involved with language. The damage may be from:\\n\\nStroke, which is the most common cause of aphasia\\nBrain tumor\\nBrain infection or inflammation\\n Brain injury\\nOther brain disorders or neurologic diseases that affect the brain and get worse over time, such as dementia\\n\\nWho is more likely to develop aphasia?\\nAnyone can have aphasia at any age, but most people with aphasia are middle-aged or older. Most aphasia happens suddenly from a stroke or brain injury. Aphasia from a brain tumor or other brain disorder may develop slowly over time.\\nHow is aphasia diagnosed?\\nIf a health care provider sees signs of aphasia, the provider will usually:\\n\\nTest the person's ability to understand language and speech. This includes asking questions and checking to see if the person can follow simple commands.\\nOrder an imaging scan to see if there's a brain injury and what part of the brain is damaged. Possible tests include:\\n  \\nMRI\\nCT scan\\n\\n\\n\\nIf imaging shows signs of aphasia, more tests may be needed. These tests measure how much the brain damage has affected the ability to talk, read, write, and understand. In most cases, the tests are done by a speech-language pathologist or speech therapist (a specialist who treats speech and communication disorders).\\nWhat are the treatments for aphasia?\\nSome people fully recover from aphasia without treatment. But most people should begin speech-language therapy to treat aphasia as soon as possible.\\nTreatment may be one-on-one with a speech therapist or in a group. Therapy using a computer may also be helpful.\\nThe specific therapy depends on the type of language loss that a person has. It may include exercises in reading, writing, following directions, and repeating what the therapist says. Therapy may also include learning how to communicate with gestures, pictures, smartphones, or other electronic devices.\\nFamily participation may be an important part of speech therapy. Family members can learn to help with recovery in many ways, such as:\\n\\nUsing simpler language\\nIncluding the person with aphasia in conversations\\nRepeating or writing down key words to help communicate more clearly\\n\\nLanguage abilities may continue to improve over many years. In general, people recover their ability to understand language more fully than their ability to speak.\\nHow much a person recovers depends on many things, including:\\n\\nWhat caused the brain injury\\nWhat part of the brain was hurt\\nHow badly and how much of the brain was hurt\\nThe age and health of the person\\n\\nCan aphasia be prevented?\\nYou can help prevent aphasia by:\\n\\nMaking heart-healthy lifestyle changes to lower your chance of having:\\n  \\nA stroke\\nHeart disease\\nVascular disease (problems with your blood vessels)\\n\\nProtecting your brain from injury:\\n  \\nWearing the right helmet for sports safety, such as when riding a bike\\nTaking action to prevent falls\\nAlways wearing your seatbelt and driving safely\\n\\n\\n\\nNIH: National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders\\n\",\n",
       " 'Cleft Lip and Palate': '\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nCleft lip and cleft palate are birth defects that occur when a baby\\'s lip or mouth do not form properly.  They happen early during pregnancy. A baby can have a cleft lip, a cleft palate, or both.\\nA cleft lip happens if the tissue that makes up the lip does not join completely before birth. This causes an opening in the upper lip. The opening can be a small slit or a large opening that goes through the lip into the nose. It can be on one or both sides of the lip or, rarely, in the middle of the lip.\\nChildren with a cleft lip also can have a cleft palate. The roof of the mouth is called the \"palate.\" With a cleft palate, the tissue that makes up the roof of the mouth does not join correctly.  Babies may have both the front and back parts of the palate open, or they may have only one part open.\\nChildren with a cleft lip or a cleft palate often have problems with feeding and talking. They also might have ear infections, hearing loss, and problems with their teeth.\\nOften, surgery can close the lip and palate. Cleft lip surgery is usually done before age 12 months, and cleft palate surgery is done before 18 months. Many children have other complications. They may need additional surgeries, dental and orthodontic care, and speech therapy as they get older. With treatment, most children with clefts do well and lead a healthy life.\\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention\\n',\n",
       " 'Reye Syndrome': '\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nReye syndrome is a rare illness that can affect the blood, liver, and brain of someone who has recently had a viral infection. It always follows another illness. Although it mostly affects children and teens, anyone can get it. It can develop quickly and without warning. It is most common during flu season. Symptoms include:\\nNausea and vomiting\\nListlessness \\nPersonality change - such as irritability, combativeness or confusion\\nDelirium \\nConvulsions \\nLoss of consciousness\\n\\nIf these symptoms occur soon after a viral illness, seek medical attention immediately. Reye syndrome can lead to a coma and brain death, so quick diagnosis and treatment are critical. Treatment focuses on preventing brain damage.  There is no cure.\\nThe cause of Reye syndrome is unknown. Studies have shown that taking aspirin increases the risk of getting it. Because of that, health care professionals now recommend other pain relievers for young patients.\\nNIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke\\n',\n",

Radon comes from the natural breakdown of uranium in soil, rock, and water. Radon is the second leading cause of lung cancer in the United States.  \\nThere are low levels of radon outdoors. Indoors, there can be high levels.  Radon can enter homes and buildings through cracks in floors, walls, or foundations.  Radon can also be in your water, especially well water. Testing is the only way to know if your home has elevated radon levels. It is inexpensive and easy. You can buy a test kit at most hardware stores or hire someone to do a test.  Radon reduction systems can bring the amount of radon down to a safe level. The cost depends on the size and design of your home.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Ozone': '\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nOzone is a gas. It can be good or bad, depending on where it is. \"Good\" ozone occurs naturally about 10 to 30 miles above the Earth\\'s surface. It shields us from the sun\\'s ultraviolet rays. Part of the good ozone layer is gone. Man-made chemicals have destroyed it. Without enough good ozone, people may get too much ultraviolet radiation.  This may increase the risk of skin cancer, cataracts, and immune system problems.\\n\"Bad\" ozone is at ground level. It forms when pollutants from cars, factories, and other sources react chemically with sunlight. It is the main ingredient in smog. It is usually worst in the summer. Breathing bad ozone can be harmful. It can cause coughing, throat irritation, worsening of asthma, bronchitis, and emphysema. It can lead to permanent lung damage, if you are regularly exposed to it.\\nEnvironmental Protection Agency\\n',\n",

Researchers believe that the virus first spreads from an infected animal to a human. It can then spread from human to human through direct contact with a patient's blood or secretions.\\nSymptoms of Ebola may appear anywhere from 2 to 21 days after exposure to the virus. Symptoms usually include:\\nFever\\nHeadache\\nJoint and muscle aches\\nWeakness\\nDiarrhea\\nVomiting\\nStomach pain\\nLack of appetite\\n\\nOther symptoms including rash, red eyes, and internal and external bleeding, may also occur.\\nThe early symptoms of Ebola are similar to other, more common, diseases. This makes it difficult to diagnose Ebola in someone who has been infected for only a few days. However, if a person has the early symptoms of Ebola and there is reason to suspect Ebola, the patient should be isolated. It is also important to notify public health professionals.  Lab tests can confirm whether the patient has Ebola.\\nThere is no cure for Ebola. Treatment involves supportive care such as fluids, oxygen, and treatment of complications. Some people who get Ebola are able to recover, but many do not.\\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention\\n\",\n",
       " 'Gastroenteritis': '\\n\\nSummary\\n\\n Have you ever had the \"stomach flu?\" What you probably had was gastroenteritis - not a type of flu at all.  Gastroenteritis is an inflammation of the lining of the intestines caused by a virus, bacteria, or parasites.  Viral gastroenteritis is the second most common illness in the U.S. The cause is often a norovirus infection. It spreads through contaminated food or water or by contact with an infected person.  The best prevention is frequent hand washing.  \\nSymptoms of gastroenteritis include diarrhea, abdominal pain, vomiting, headache, fever, and chills.  Most people recover with no treatment.\\nThe most common problem with gastroenteritis is dehydration. This happens if you do not drink enough fluids to replace what you lose through vomiting and diarrhea. Dehydration is most common in babies, young children, older adults, and people with weak immune systems.  \\nNIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases\\n',\n",

       " 'Knee Injuries and Disorders': '\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nYour knee joint is made up of bone, cartilage, ligaments and fluid. Muscles and tendons help the knee joint move. When any of these structures is hurt or diseased, you have knee problems. Knee problems can cause pain and difficulty walking.\\nKnee problems are very common, and they occur in people of all ages. Knee problems can interfere with many things, from participation in sports to simply getting up from a chair and walking. This can have a big impact on your life.\\nThe most common disease affecting the knee is osteoarthritis. The cartilage in the knee gradually wears away, causing pain and swelling.\\nInjuries to ligaments and tendons also cause knee problems. A common injury is to the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). You usually injure your ACL by a sudden twisting motion. ACL and other knee injuries are common sports injuries.\\nTreatment of knee problems depends on the cause. In some cases your doctor may recommend knee replacement.\\nNIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases\\n',\n",
       " 'Guillain-Barre Syndrome': '\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nGuillain-Barre syndrome is a rare disorder that causes your immune system to attack your peripheral nervous system (PNS). The PNS nerves connect your brain and spinal cord with the rest of your body. Damage to these nerves makes it hard for them to transmit signals. As a result, your muscles have trouble responding to your brain. No one knows what causes the syndrome. Sometimes it is triggered by an infection, surgery, or a vaccination. \\nThe first symptom is usually weakness or a tingling feeling in your legs. The feeling can spread to your upper body. In severe cases, you become almost paralyzed. This is life-threatening. You might need a respirator to breathe. Symptoms usually worsen over a period of weeks and then stabilize.\\n Guillain-Barre can be hard to diagnose.  Possible tests include nerve tests and a spinal tap. Most people recover. Recovery can take a few weeks to a few years. Treatment can help symptoms, and may include medicines or a procedure called plasma exchange.\\nNIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke\\n',\n",
       " 'Gout': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nGout is a common, painful form of arthritis. It causes swollen, red, hot and stiff joints.\\nGout happens when uric acid builds up in your body.  Uric acid comes from the breakdown of substances called purines. Purines are in your body's tissues and in foods, such as liver, dried beans and peas, and anchovies. Normally, uric acid dissolves in the blood. It passes through the kidneys and out of the body in urine. But sometimes uric acid can build up and form needle-like crystals. When they form in your joints, it is very painful. The crystals can also cause kidney stones.\\nOften, gout first attacks your big toe. It can also attack ankles, heels, knees, wrists, fingers, and elbows. At first, gout attacks usually get better in days. Eventually, attacks last longer and happen more often.\\nYou are more likely to get gout if you:\\nAre a man\\nHave family member with gout\\nAre overweight\\nDrink alcohol\\nEat too many foods rich in purines\\n\\nGout can be hard to diagnose. Your doctor may take a sample of fluid from an inflamed joint to look for crystals. You can treat gout with medicines.\\nPseudogout has similar symptoms and is sometimes confused with gout.

About 40 of them are spread through direct sexual contact with someone who has the virus. They can also spread through other intimate, skin-to-skin contact. Some of these types can cause cancer.\\nThere are two categories of sexually transmitted HPV. Low-risk HPV can cause warts on or around your genitals, anus, mouth, or throat. High-risk HPV can cause various cancers:\\n\\nCervical cancer\\nAnal cancer\\nSome types of oral and throat cancer\\nVulvar cancer\\nVaginal cancer\\nPenile cancer\\n\\nMost HPV infections go away on their own and don't cause cancer. But sometimes the infections last longer. When a high-risk HPV infection lasts for many years, it can lead to cell changes. If these changes are not treated, they may get worse over time and become cancer.\\nWho is at risk for HPV infections?\\nHPV infections are very common. Nearly all sexually active people are infected with HPV soon after they become sexually active.\\nWhat are the symptoms of HPV infections?\\nSome people develop warts from certain low-risk HPV infections, but the other types (including the high-risk types) have no symptoms.\\nIf a high-risk HPV infection lasts for many years and causes cell changes, you may have symptoms. You may also have symptoms if those cell changes develop into cancer. Which symptoms you have depends on which part of the body is affected.\\nHow are HPV infections diagnosed?\\nHealth care providers can usually diagnose warts by looking at them.\\nFor women, there are cervical cancer screening tests which can find changes in the cervix that might lead to cancer.  As part of the screening, women may have Pap tests, HPV tests , or both.\\nWhat are the treatments for HPV infections?\\nAn HPV infection itself cannot be treated. There are medicines that you can apply to a wart. If they don't work, your health care provide could freeze, burn, or surgically remove it.\\nThere are treatments for the cell changes caused by infection with high-risk HPV. They include medicines that you apply to the area that is affected and various surgical procedures.\\nPeople who have HPV-related cancers usually get the same types of treatment as people who have cancers that are not caused by HPV. An exception to this is for people who have certain oral and throat cancers. They may have different treatment options.\\nCan HPV infections be prevented?\\nCorrect usage of latex condoms greatly reduces, but does not completely eliminate, the risk of catching or spreading HPV. If your or your partner is allergic to latex, you can use polyurethane condoms. The most reliable way to avoid infection is to not have anal, vaginal, or oral sex.\\nVaccines can protect against several types of HPV, including some that can cause cancer. The vaccines provide the most protection when people get them before they are exposed to the virus. This means that it is best for people to get them before they become sexually active.\\nNIH: National Cancer Institute\\n\",\n",

Dementia is a brain disorder that seriously affects a person's ability to carry out daily activities. \\nAD begins slowly. It first involves the parts of the brain that control thought, memory and language. People with AD may have trouble remembering things that happened recently or names of people they know. A related problem, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), causes more memory problems than normal for people of the same age.  Many, but not all, people with MCI will develop AD.\\nIn AD, over time, symptoms get worse. People may not recognize family members. They may have trouble speaking, reading or writing. They may forget how to brush their teeth or comb their hair. Later on, they may become anxious or aggressive, or wander away from home. Eventually, they need total care.

Biological therapy uses substances that are made from living organisms, or versions of these substances that are made in a lab.\\nDoctors don\\'t yet use immunotherapy as often as other cancer treatments, such as surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. But they do use immunotherapy for some types of cancer, and researchers are doing clinical trials to see whether it also works for other types.\\nWhen you have cancer, some of your cells begin to multiply without stopping. They spread into the surrounding tissues. One reason that the cancer cells can keep growing and spreading is that they are able to hide from your immune system. Some immunotherapies can \"mark\" your cancer cells. This makes it easier for your immune system to find and destroy the cells. It is a type of targeted therapy, which uses drugs or other substances that attack specific cancer cells with less harm to normal cells. Other types of immunotherapies work by boosting your immune system to work better against cancer.\\nYou could get immunotherapy intravenously (by IV), in pills or capsules, or in a cream for your skin. For bladder cancer, they might place it directly into your bladder. You may have treatment every day, week, or month. Some immunotherapies are given in cycles. It depends on your type of cancer, how advanced it is, the type of immunotherapy you get, and how well it is working.\\nYou may have side effects.

You work with a team of health care providers to find ways to lessen your symptoms, increase your ability to exercise, and make it easier to do your daily activities.\\nWho needs pulmonary rehabilitation?\\nYour health care provider may recommend pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) if you have a chronic lung disease or another condition that makes it hard for you to breathe and limits your activities. For example, PR may help you if you:\\nHave COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). The two main types are emphysema and chronic bronchitis. In COPD, your airways (tubes that carry air in and out of your lungs) are partially blocked. This makes it hard to get air in and out.\\nHave an interstitial lung disease such as sarcoidosis and pulmonary fibrosis. These diseases cause scarring of the lungs over time. This makes it hard to get enough oxygen.\\nHave cystic fibrosis (CF). CF is an inherited disease that causes thick, sticky mucus to collect in the lungs and block the airways.\\nNeed lung surgery. You may have PR before and after lung surgery to help you prepare for and recover from the surgery.\\nHave a muscle-wasting disorder that affects the muscles used for breathing. An example is muscular dystrophy.\\n\\nPR works best if you start it before your disease is severe. However, even people who have advanced lung disease can benefit from PR.\\nWhat does pulmonary rehabilitation include?\\nWhen you first start pulmonary rehabilitation (PR), your team of health care providers will want to learn more about your health. You will have lung function, exercise, and possibly blood tests. Your team will go over your medical history and current treatments. They may check on your mental health and ask about your diet. Then they will work together to create a plan that is right for you. It may include:\\nExercise training. Your team will come up with an exercise plan to improve your endurance and muscle strength. You will likely have exercises for both your arms and legs. You might use a treadmill, stationary bike, or weights. You may need to start slowly and increase your exercise as you get stronger.\\nNutritional counseling. Being either overweight or underweight can affect your breathing. A nutritious eating plan can help you work towards a healthy weight.\\nEducation about your disease and how to manage it. This includes learning how to avoid situations that make your symptoms worse, how to avoid infections, and how/when to take your medicines.\\nTechniques you can use to save your energy. Your team may teach you easier ways to do daily tasks. For example, you may learn ways to avoid reaching, lifting, or bending. Those movements make it harder to breathe, since they use up energy and make you tighten your abdominal muscles. You may also learn how to better deal with stress, since stress can also take up energy and affect your breathing.\\nBreathing strategies. You will learn techniques to improve your breathing. These techniques may increase your oxygen levels, decrease how often you take breaths, and keep your airways open longer.\\nPsychological counseling and/or group support. It can feel scary to have trouble breathing. If you have a chronic lung disease, you are more likely to have depression, anxiety, or other emotional problems. Many PR programs include counseling and/or support groups. If not, your PR team may be able to refer you to an organization that offers them.\\n\\nNIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute\\n',\n",

       " 'Adrenal Gland Disorders': '\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nWhat are adrenal glands?\\nYour adrenal glands are two small organs that sit on top of each kidney. The adrenal glands make different types of hormones you need to stay alive and healthy. Hormones are chemicals that travel in your bloodstream and control how different parts of your body work.\\nThe adrenal glands make the hormones cortisol, aldosterone, adrenaline, and noradrenaline. They also make hormones that your body uses to make sex hormones (estrogen and testosterone). All of these hormones do many important jobs, including:\\nTurning food into energy and managing blood sugar levels\\nBalancing salt and water\\nKeeping blood pressure normal\\nResponding to illness and stress (your \"fight or flight\" response)\\nTiming when and how fast a child develops sexually\\nSupporting pregnancy\\n\\nWhat are adrenal gland disorders?\\nWhen you have an adrenal gland disorder, your body makes too much or too little of one or more hormones. The symptoms depend on the type of problem you have and how much it affects the hormone levels in your body.\\nThere are many types of adrenal gland disorders, including:\\nAddison\\'s Disease - a condition in which the adrenal glands don\\'t make enough cortisol\\nCushing\\'s Syndrome - a condition caused by too much cortisol in the body, often from taking steroid medicines for a long time\\nAldosterone-producing adenoma - a benign tumor (not cancer) that makes too much aldosterone and may cause serious high blood pressure\\nHereditary paraganglioma-pheochromocytoma - an inherited condition causing different types of tumors that make adrenaline and other hormones. Some tumors may become cancerous.\\nAdrenal gland cancer - cancerous tumors, including adrenocortical carcinoma and neuroblastoma\\nCongenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH) - a group of inherited disorders in which the adrenal glands don\\'t make enough cortisol. The most common type is 21-hydroxylase deficiency (also called CAH1). In the United States, newborn babies get a blood test to see if they have CAH. People born with CAH may not have symptoms until childhood or later in life.\\n\\nWhat causes adrenal gland disorders?\\nThe cause of adrenal gland disorders depends on the type of disorder you have. Causes can include:\\nMedicines such as steroids\\nA problem in another gland, such as the pituitary gland. The pituitary gland releases hormones that affect how the adrenal glands work.\\nChanges in genes (mutations). These changes can cause the adrenal glands to make too much or too little of one or more hormones.\\nInfections\\n\\nIn many cases the cause of the problem isn\\'t clear.\\nHow are adrenal gland disorders diagnosed?\\nHealth care providers use different tests to check for adrenal disorders depending on your symptoms and health history.  For example, you may have tests of your blood, urine (pee), or saliva (spit).  These tests check your hormone levels. Your provider may order x-rays, CT scans, or MRI scans to look for tumors.\\nWhat are the treatments for adrenal gland disorders?\\nDifferent types of adrenal gland disorders have different treatments. They include medicines and surgery.  Radiation therapy is sometimes a treatment for tumors. There are treatments to cure certain adrenal gland disorders. For other disorders, treatments can manage your symptoms.\\nNIH: National Institute of Child Health and Human Development\\n',\n",

       " 'Diabetes': '\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nDiabetes is a disease in which your blood glucose, or blood sugar, levels are too high.  Glucose comes from the foods you eat. Insulin is a hormone that helps the glucose get into your cells to give them energy.  With type 1 diabetes, your body does not make insulin.  With type 2 diabetes, the more common type, your body does not make or use insulin well. Without enough insulin, the glucose stays in your blood. You can also have prediabetes.  This means that your blood sugar is higher than normal but not high enough to be called diabetes.  Having prediabetes puts you at a higher risk of getting type 2 diabetes.\\nOver time, having too much glucose in your blood can cause serious problems.    It can damage your eyes, kidneys, and nerves. Diabetes can also cause heart disease, stroke and even the need to remove a limb. Pregnant women can also get diabetes, called gestational diabetes.\\nBlood tests can show if you have diabetes. One type of test, the A1C, can also check on how you are managing your diabetes. Exercise, weight control and sticking to your meal plan can help control your diabetes. You should also monitor your blood glucose level and take medicine if prescribed. \\n\\nNIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases\\n',\n",

The virus spreads through sexual contact. Most women's bodies are able to fight HPV infection. But sometimes the virus leads to cancer. You're at higher risk if you smoke, have had many children, use birth control pills for a long time, or have HIV infection. \\nCervical cancer may not cause any symptoms at first. Later, you may have pelvic pain or bleeding from the vagina. It usually takes several years for normal cells in the cervix to turn into cancer cells. Your health care provider can find abnormal cells by doing a Pap test to examine cells from the cervix. You may also have an HPV test.  If your results are abnormal, you may need a biopsy or other tests. By getting regular screenings, you can find and treat any problems before they turn into cancer.\\nTreatment may include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or a combination.

You may have new feelings and thoughts about sex. Understanding who you\\'re becoming as a sexual young adult is also part of teen sexual health. For some teens, that includes understanding gender identity, gender expression, and sexual orientation.\\nFor all teens, taking responsibility for sexual health is part of growing up. Whether you choose to have sex or wait, responsibility includes knowing about:\\nSexually transmitted diseases (STDs)\\nBirth control\\nWhat a healthy relationship is\\n\\nWhat are sexually transmitted diseases (STDs)?\\nSexually transmitted diseases (STDs), or sexually transmitted infections (STIs), are caused by bacteria, viruses, and parasites that spread from person to person, usually during vaginal, oral, or anal sex. Some STDs are spread by skin-to-skin contact. Without treatment, some STDs can cause long-term health problems.\\nThere are more than 20 types of STDs, including:\\nChlamydia\\nGenital herpes\\nGonorrhea\\nHIV/AIDS\\nHPV (human papillomavirus)\\nPubic lice\\nSyphilis\\nTrichomoniasis\\n\\nSTDs don\\'t always cause symptoms. So it is possible to have an infection without knowing it and then pass it on to someone else. The only way to know for sure whether you have an STD is to get tested.\\nHow can I reduce my chances of getting a sexually transmitted disease (STD)?\\nThe most reliable way to avoid infection is to not have vaginal, oral, or anal sex. Saying \"no\" to sex is the right choice for many teens. \\nIf you decide to have sex, \"safer sex\" practices will lower your chance of getting an STD.

You can be vaccinated between ages 9 and 26.\\nUsing condoms correctly every time you have vaginal, oral, or anal sex:\\n\\nExternal (male) latex condoms provide the best protection against STDs. If you or your partner is allergic to latex, you can use polyurethane condoms.\\nInternal (female) condoms, made of nitrile, are placed inside the body (vagina or anus). They may be less effective against STDs than latex external condoms.\\nDon\\'t use both type of condoms together because that increases the chance they\\'ll rip\\nUse a dental dam (a square piece of latex, polyurethane, or nitrile) to protect the mouth during oral sex\\n\\nHaving sex with only one person who has sex only with you (mutual monogamy). But first, both of you should get tested for STDs.\\nNot mixing alcohol or drugs with sex. You need to think clearly to make safer choices about sex.\\n\\nHow can I reduce the chance of pregnancy?\\nThe only sure way to avoid pregnancy is not to have vaginal sex.\\nIf you decide to have vaginal sex, birth control can help prevent pregnancy. There are many types of birth control that work in different ways.  Your health care provider can help you choose birth control that\\'s best for you.\\nCondoms are the only birth control method that protects against STDs. But condoms alone aren\\'t the most effective form of birth control. It\\'s safest to use condoms with another form of birth control to prevent both STDs and pregnancy.\\nWhat is a healthy relationship?\\nHealthy sex starts with a healthy relationship, so it\\'s important to take an honest look at how you and your partner treat each other. Your relationship may be healthy if it includes:\\nRespect. You and your partner value each other\\'s feelings. Neither of you pressure the other to do things they don\\'t want to do.\\nTrust and honesty. You always tell the truth and trust your partner to do the same.\\nGood communication. You feel safe talking openly about your feelings, STDs, and other relationships. And you both listen.\\n\\nYour relationship may be unhealthy if it includes:\\nJealousy and control. One of you wants to make all the decisions and tries to keep the other from spending time with their friends and family.\\nDisrespect. One of you makes fun of the other person\\'s ideas and feelings.\\nPressure. One of you tries to bully the other into doing sexual things they don\\'t want to do.\\nViolence. Hitting, shoving, grabbing, and sexual assault should never be part of a relationship. If you don\\'t know how to end a violent relationship, get help.\\n\\nYour decisions about sex can affect your future health. Make sure that you know the facts so you can decide what is right for you.\\n',\n",
       " 'Complementary and Integrative Medicine': '\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nMany Americans use medical treatments that are not part of mainstream medicine. When you are using these types of care, it may be called complementary, integrative, or alternative medicine.\\nComplementary medicine is used together with mainstream medical care. An example is using acupuncture to help with side effects of cancer treatment. When health care providers and facilities offer both types of care, it is called integrative medicine. Alternative medicine is used instead of mainstream medical care.\\nThe claims that non-mainstream practitioners make can sound promising. However, researchers do not know how safe many of these treatments are or how well they work.

They can also occur together. Delirium starts suddenly and can cause hallucinations. The symptoms may get better or worse and can last for hours or weeks.  On the other hand, dementia develops slowly and does not cause hallucinations. The symptoms are stable and may last for months or years.\\nWhat are the treatments for delirium?\\nTreatment of delirium focuses on the causes and symptoms of delirium. The first step is to identify the cause. Often, treating the cause will lead to a full recovery. The recovery may take some time - weeks or sometimes even months. In the meantime, there may be treatments to manage the symptoms, such as:\\nControlling the environment, which includes making sure that the room is quiet and well-lit, having clocks or calendars in view, and having family members around\\nMedicines, including those that control aggression or agitation and pain relievers if there is pain\\nIf needed, making sure that the person has a hearing aid, glasses, or other devices for communication\\n\\nCan delirium be prevented?\\nTreating the conditions that can cause delirium may reduce the risk of getting it. Hospitals can help lower the risk of delirium by avoiding sedatives and making sure that the room is kept quiet, calm, and well-lit. It can also help to have family members around and to have the same staff members treat the person.\\n\",\n",

       " 'Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia': '\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nWhat is leukemia?\\nLeukemia is a term for cancers of the blood cells. Leukemia starts in blood-forming tissues such as the bone marrow. Your bone marrow makes the cells which will develop into white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. Each type of cell has a different job:\\nWhite blood cells help your body fight infection\\nRed blood cells deliver oxygen from your lungs to your tissues and organs\\nPlatelets help form clots to stop bleeding\\n\\nWhen you have leukemia, your bone marrow makes large numbers of abnormal cells. This problem most often happens with white blood cells. These abnormal cells build up in your bone marrow and blood. They crowd out the healthy blood cells and make it hard for your cells and blood to do their work.\\nWhat is acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL)?\\nAcute lymphocytic leukemia is a type of acute leukemia. It\\'s also called ALL and acute lymphoblastic leukemia. \"Acute\" means that it usually gets worse quickly if it\\'s not treated. ALL is the most common type of cancer in children. It can also affect adults.\\nIn ALL, the bone marrow makes too many lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell. These cells normally help your body fight infection. But in ALL, they are abnormal and cannot fight infection very well. They also crowd out the healthy cells, which can lead to infection, anemia, and easy bleeding. These abnormal cells can also spread to other parts of the body, including the brain and spinal cord.\\nWhat causes acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL)?\\nALL happens when there are changes in the genetic material (DNA) in bone marrow cells. The cause of these genetic changes is unknown. However, there are certain factors that raise your risk of ALL.\\nWho is at risk for acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL)?\\nThe factors that raise your risk of ALL include:\\nBeing male\\nBeing white\\nBeing over age 70\\nHaving had chemotherapy or radiation therapy\\nHaving been exposed to high levels of radiation\\nHaving certain genetic disorders, such as Down syndrome\\n\\nWhat are the symptoms of acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL)?\\nThe signs and symptoms of ALL include:\\nWeakness or feeling tired\\nFever or night sweats\\nEasy bruising or bleeding\\nPetechiae, which are tiny red dots under the skin. They are caused by bleeding.\\nShortness of breath\\nWeight loss or loss of appetite\\nPain in the bones or stomach\\nPain or feeling of fullness below the ribs\\nSwollen lymph nodes - you may notice them as painless lumps in the neck, underarm, stomach, or groin\\nHaving had many infections\\n\\nHow is acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) diagnosed?\\nYour health care provider may use many tools to diagnose ALL and figure out which subtype you have:\\nA physical exam\\nA medical history\\nBlood tests, such as\\n      \\nComplete blood count (CBC) with differential\\nBlood chemistry tests such as a basic metabolic panel (BMP), comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), kidney function tests, liver function tests, and electrolyte panel\\nBlood smear\\n\\n\\nBone marrow tests. There are two main types - bone marrow aspiration and bone marrow biopsy. Both tests involve removing a sample of bone marrow and bone. The samples are sent to a lab for testing.\\nGenetic tests to look for gene and chromosome changes\\n\\nIf you are diagnosed with ALL, you may have additional tests to see whether the cancer has spread. These include imaging tests and a lumbar puncture, which is a procedure to collect and test cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).\\nWhat are the treatments for acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL)?\\nTreatments for ALL include:\\nChemotherapy\\nRadiation therapy\\nChemotherapy with stem cell transplant\\nTargeted therapy, which uses drugs or other substances that attack specific cancer cells with less harm to normal cells\\n\\nTreatment is usually done in two phases:\\nThe goal of the first phase is to kill the leukemia cells in the blood and bone marrow. This treatment puts the leukemia into remission. Remission means that the signs and symptoms of cancer are reduced or have disappeared.\\nThe second phase is known as post-remission therapy. Its goal is to prevent a relapse (return) of the cancer. It involves killing any remaining leukemia cells that may not be active but could begin to regrow.\\n\\nTreatment during both phases also usually includes central nervous system (CNS) prophylaxis therapy. This therapy helps prevent the spread of leukemia cells to the brain and spinal cord. It may be high dose chemotherapy or chemotherapy injected into the spinal cord. It also sometimes includes radiation therapy.\\nNIH: National Cancer Institute\\n',\n",

       " 'Mitral Valve Prolapse': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nWhat is the mitral valve?\\nThe mitral valve is one of the four valves in your heart. Heart valves have flaps that open and close. The flaps make sure that blood flows in the right direction through your heart and to the rest of your body. When your heart beats, the flaps open to let blood through. Between heartbeats they close to stop the blood from flowing backwards.\\nThe mitral valve opens to let blood flow from your heart's upper left chamber to the lower left chamber. When the lower left chamber contracts (squeezes) to pump blood to your body, the mitral valve closes tightly to keep any blood from flowing backwards.\\nWhat is mitral valve prolapse (MVP)?\\nMitral valve prolapse (MVP) happens when the flaps of the mitral valve become floppy and don't close tightly. In some cases, blood may leak backwards through the valve to the chamber it came from. This is called backflow, or regurgitation. When there is a lot of mitral valve backflow, the heart can't push enough blood out to the body.\\nBut most people who have MVP don't have any backflow. In fact, MVP doesn't cause any health problems for most people who have it.\\nWho is more likely to develop mitral valve prolapse (MVP)?\\nAnyone can have MVP. Most people who have it were born with it. MVP tends to run in families, but researchers don't know the exact cause.\\nYou may be more likely to develop MVP if you:\\n\\nAre older. The risk of MVP increases as aging affects the valve.\\nHad rheumatic fever, a disease that can develop after a strep throat infection and cause damage to the heart valves.\\nWere born with a connective tissue disorder, such as Marfan syndrome or Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.\\nHave Graves' disease, a type of thyroid condition.\\nHave scoliosis (a side-to-side curve of the spine) or other problems with the bones of your body.\\nHave some types of muscular dystrophy.\\n\\nMitral valve prolapse with backflow is most common in men and people who have high blood pressure.\\nWhat are the symptoms of mitral valve prolapse (MVP)?\\nMost people who have MVP don't have any symptoms. But if it does cause symptoms, they may include:\\n\\nHeart palpitations (feeling that your heart is fluttering, skipping beats, or beating too hard or too fast)\\nShortness of breath (feeling like you can't get enough air)\\nA cough\\nFatigue, dizziness, or anxiety\\nA migraine\\nChest pain\\n\\nWhat other problems can mitral valve prolapse (MVP) cause?\\nIn rare cases, MVP can cause other problems. They're most often caused by backflow. They can include:\\n\\nArrhythmia, a problem with the rate or rhythm of your heartbeat\\nEndocarditis, an infection in the lining of the heart and heart valves\\nHeart failure\\n\\nHow is mitral valve prolapse (MVP) diagnosed?\\nHealth care providers often find MVP during routine health check-ups. If you have MVP, your provider may hear a clicking sound when listening to your heart with a stethoscope. If blood flows backwards through the valve, your heart may also make a whooshing sound called a heart murmur.\\nYou may also need certain heart tests. The most useful test is an echocardiogram, or echo. This is a type of ultrasound that uses sound waves to make a moving picture of your heart.\\nWhat are the treatments for mitral valve prolapse (MVP)?\\nMost people don't need any treatment for MVP. If you have symptoms with little or no backflow, you may only need medicine to relieve your discomfort.\\nIf the amount of backflow is significant, you may need treatment to prevent other heart problems from developing. Treatments may include:\\n\\nMedicines to help your heart work better.\\nHeart surgery to repair or replace a very abnormal mitral valve with backflow. The goal of surgery is to improve your symptoms and reduce your risk of developing heart failure.\\n\\nWhen possible, valve repair is generally preferred over replacement. That's because repairs are less likely to weaken the heart muscle, and they're less likely to cause heart infection.\\nCan mitral valve prolapse be prevented?\\nYou can't prevent mitral valve prolapse. But if you have mitral valve prolapse, you can help prevent the rare but serious problems it can cause by:\\n\\nBrushing and flossing your teeth regularly. That helps keep bacteria out of your bloodstream, which further reduces the rare risk of a heart infection.\\nAsking your provider if you need to take antibiotics before dental work or surgery to lower your risk of heart infection. This mostly applies to people who have had valve repair or replacement surgery.\\nGetting regular check-ups and taking any medicines that your provider may have prescribed.\\nMaking heart-healthy habits part of your life to prevent heart disease.\\n\\nNIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute\\n\",\n",

Spinal cord injuries usually begin with a blow that fractures (breaks) or dislocates your vertebrae, the bone disks that make up your spine. Most injuries don't cut through your spinal cord. Instead, they cause damage when pieces of vertebrae tear into cord tissue or press down on the nerve parts that carry signals.\\nSpinal cord injuries can be complete or incomplete. With a complete spinal cord injury, the cord can't send signals below the level of the injury. As a result, you are paralyzed below the injury.

       " 'Pancreatic Cancer': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nThe pancreas is a gland behind your stomach and in front of your spine. It produces the juices that help break down food and the hormones that help control blood sugar levels. Pancreatic cancer usually begins in the cells that produce the juices. Some risk factors for developing pancreatic cancer include:\\n\\tSmoking \\n\\tLong-term diabetes \\n\\tChronic pancreatitis \\n\\tCertain hereditary disorders \\n\\nPancreatic cancer is hard to catch early. It doesn't cause symptoms right away. When you do get symptoms, they are often vague or you may not notice them. They include yellowing of the skin and eyes, pain in the abdomen and back, weight loss and fatigue. Also, because the pancreas is hidden behind other organs, health care providers cannot see or feel the tumors during routine exams. Doctors use a physical exam, blood tests, imaging tests, and a biopsy to diagnose it.\\nBecause it is often found late and it spreads quickly, pancreatic cancer can be hard to treat.  Possible treatments include surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, and targeted therapy. Targeted therapy uses drugs or other substances that attack specific cancer cells with less harm to normal cells.\\nNIH: National Cancer Institute\\n\",\n",

       " 'Esophagus Disorders': '\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nThe esophagus is the muscular tube that carries food and liquids from your mouth to the stomach. You may not be aware of your esophagus until you swallow something too large, too hot, or too cold. You may also notice it when something is wrong. You may feel pain or have trouble swallowing.\\nThe most common problem with the esophagus is GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease). With GERD, a muscle at the end of your esophagus does not close properly. This allows stomach contents to leak back, or reflux, into the esophagus and irritate it. Over time, GERD can cause damage to the esophagus.\\nOther problems include heartburn, cancer, and eosinophilic esophagitis. Doctors may use various tests to make a diagnosis. These include imaging tests, an upper endoscopy, and a biopsy.\\nTreatment depends on the problem. Some problems get better with over-the-counter medicines or changes in diet. Others may need prescription medicines or surgery.\\nNIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases\\n',\n",
       " 'Non-Drug Pain Management': '\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nWhat is pain?\\nPain is a signal in your nervous system that something may be wrong. It is an unpleasant feeling, such as a prick, tingle, sting, burn, or ache. Pain may be sharp or dull. It may come and go, or it may be constant. You may feel pain in one area of your body, such as your back, abdomen, chest, pelvis, or you may feel pain all over.\\nThere are two types of pain:\\n\\nAcute pain usually comes on suddenly, because of a disease, injury, or inflammation. It can often be diagnosed and treated. It usually goes away, though sometimes it can turn into chronic pain.\\nChronic pain lasts for a long time, and can cause severe problems\\n\\nWhat are pain relievers?\\nPain relievers are medicines that reduce or relieve pain. There are many different pain medicines, and each one has advantages and risks. Some are over-the-counter (OTC) medicines. Others are stronger medicines, which are available by prescription. The most powerful prescription pain relievers are opioids. They are very effective, but people who take them are at risk of addiction and overdose.\\nBecause of the side effects and risks of pain relievers, you may want to try non-drug treatments first. And if you do need to take medicines, also doing some non-drug treatments may allow you to take a lower dose.\\nWhat are some non-drug treatments for pain?\\nThere are many non-drug treatments that can help with pain. It is important to check with your health care provider before trying any of them:\\n\\nAcupuncture involves stimulating acupuncture points. These are specific points on your body. There are different acupuncture methods. The most common one involves inserting thin needles through the skin. Others include using pressure, electrical stimulation, and heat. Acupuncture is based on the belief that qi (vital energy) flows through the body along paths, called meridians. Practitioners believe that stimulating the acupuncture points can rebalance the qi. Research suggests that acupuncture can help manage certain pain conditions.\\nBiofeedback techniques use electronic devices to measure body functions such as breathing and heart rate. This teaches you to be more aware of your body functions so you can learn to control them. For example, a biofeedback device may show you measurements of your muscle tension. By watching how these measurements change, you can become more aware of when your muscles are tense and learn to relax them. Biofeedback may help to control pain, including chronic headaches and back pain.\\nElectrical stimulation involves using a device to send a gentle electric current to your nerves or muscles. This can help treat pain by interrupting or blocking the pain signals. Types include\\n\\nTranscutaneous electrical stimulation (TENS)\\nImplanted electric nerve stimulation\\nDeep brain or spinal cord stimulation\\n\\nMassage therapy is a treatment in which the soft tissues of the body are kneaded, rubbed, tapped, and stroked. Among other benefits, it may help people relax, and relieve stress and pain.\\nMeditation is a mind-body practice in which you focus your attention on something, such as an object, word, phrase, or breathing. This helps you to minimize distracting or stressful thoughts or feelings.\\nPhysical therapy uses techniques such as heat, cold, exercise, massage, and manipulation. It can help to control pain, as well as condition muscles and restore strength.\\nPsychotherapy (talk therapy) uses methods such as discussion, listening, and counseling to treat mental and behavioral disorders. It can also help people who have pain, especially chronic pain, by\\n\\nTeaching them coping skills, to be able to better deal with the stress that pain can cause\\nAddressing negative thoughts and emotions that can make pain worse\\nProviding them with support\\n\\nRelaxation therapy can help reduce muscle tension and stress, lower blood pressure, and control pain. It may involve tensing and relaxing muscles throughout the body. It may be used with guided imagery (focusing the mind on positive images) and meditation.\\nSurgery can sometimes be necessary to treat severe pain, especially when it is caused by back problems or serious musculoskeletal injuries. There are always risks to getting surgery, and it does not always work to treat pain. So it is important to go through all of the risks and benefits with your health care provider.\\n\\n',\n",
       " 'Anemia': '\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nIf you have anemia, your blood does not carry enough oxygen to the rest of your body.  The most common cause of anemia is not having enough iron. Your body needs iron to make hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is an iron-rich protein that gives the red color to blood. It carries oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body.\\nAnemia has three main causes: blood loss, lack of red blood cell production, and high rates of red blood cell destruction.\\nConditions that may lead to anemia include:\\nHeavy periods\\nPregnancy\\nUlcers\\nColon polyps or colon cancer\\nInherited disorders\\nA diet that does not have enough iron, folic acid or vitamin B12\\nBlood disorders such as sickle cell anemia and thalassemia, or cancer\\nAplastic anemia, a condition that can be inherited or acquired\\nG6PD deficiency, a metabolic disorder\\n\\nAnemia can make you feel tired, cold, dizzy, and irritable.

       " 'Autoimmune Diseases': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nWhat are autoimmune diseases?\\nYour immune system protects you from disease and infection by attacking germs that get into your body, such as viruses and bacteria. Your immune system can tell that the germs aren't part of you, so it destroys them. If you have an autoimmune disease, your immune system attacks the healthy cells of your organs and tissues by mistake.\\nThere are more than 80 types of autoimmune diseases. They can affect almost any part of your body. For example, alopecia areata is an autoimmune disease of the skin that causes hair loss. Autoimmune hepatitis affects the liver. In type 1 diabetes, the immune system attacks the pancreas.  And in rheumatoid arthritis, the immune system can attack many parts of the body, including the joints, lungs, and eyes.\\nWhat causes autoimmune diseases?\\nNo one is sure why autoimmune diseases happen. But you can't catch them from other people.\\nAutoimmune diseases do tend to run in families, which means that certain genes may make some people more likely to develop a problem. Viruses, certain chemicals, and other things in the environment may trigger an autoimmune disease if you already have the genes for it.\\nWho is at risk for autoimmune diseases?\\nMillions of Americans of all ages have autoimmune diseases. Women develop many types of autoimmune diseases much more often than men. And if you have one autoimmune disease, you are more likely to get another.\\nWhat are the symptoms of autoimmune diseases?\\nThe symptoms of an autoimmune disease depend on the part of your body that's affected. Many types of autoimmune diseases cause redness, swelling, heat, and pain, which are the signs and symptoms of inflammation.  But other illnesses can cause the same symptoms.\\nThe symptoms of autoimmune diseases can come and go. During a flare-up, your symptoms may get severe for a while. Later on, you may have a remission, which means that your symptoms get better or disappear for a period of time.\\nHow are autoimmune diseases diagnosed?\\nDoctors often have a hard time diagnosing autoimmune diseases. There's usually not a specific test to show whether you have a certain autoimmune disease. And the symptoms can be confusing. That's because many autoimmune diseases have similar symptoms. And some symptoms, such as muscle aches, are common in many other illnesses. So it can take a long time and some visits to different types of doctors to get a diagnosis.\\nTo help your doctor find out if an autoimmune disease is causing your symptoms,:\\nLearn about the health conditions in your family history.  What health problems did your grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins have? Write down what you learn and share it with your doctor.\\nKeep track of your symptoms, including how long they last and what makes them better or worse. Share your notes with your doctor.\\nSee a specialist who deals with the symptoms that bother you most. For example, if you have rash, see a dermatologist (skin doctor).\\n\\nWhat are the treatments for autoimmune diseases?\\nThe treatment depends on the disease. In most cases, the goal of treatment is to suppress (slow down) your immune system, and ease swelling, redness, and pain from inflammation. Your doctor may give you corticosteroids or other medicines to help you feel better. For some diseases, you may need treatment for the rest of your life.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Adenoids': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nWhat are adenoids?\\nAdenoids are a patch of tissue that is high up in the throat, just behind the nose. They, along with the tonsils, are part of the lymphatic system. The lymphatic system clears away infection and keeps body fluids in balance. The adenoids and tonsils work by trapping germs coming in through the mouth and nose.\\nAdenoids usually start to shrink after about age 5. By the teenage years, they are almost completely gone. By then, the body has other ways to fight germs.\\nWhat are enlarged adenoids? \\nEnlarged adenoids are adenoids that are swollen. It is a common problem in children.\\nWhat causes enlarged adenoids?\\nYour child's adenoids can be enlarged, or swollen, for different reasons. It may just be that your child had enlarged adenoids at birth. Adenoids can also become enlarged when they are trying to fight off an infection. They might stay enlarged even after the infection is gone.\\nWhat problems can enlarged adenoids cause?\\nEnlarged adenoids can make it hard to breathe through the nose.  Your child might end up breathing only through the mouth. This may cause:\\nA dry mouth, which can also lead to bad breath\\nCracked lips\\nA runny nose\\n\\nOther problems that enlarged adenoids can cause include:\\nLoud breathing\\nSnoring\\nRestless sleep\\nSleep apnea, a disorder that causes you to repeatedly stop breathing fduring sleep\\nEar infections\\n\\nHow can enlarged adenoids be diagnosed?\\nYour child's health care provider will take a medical history, check your child's ears, throat, and mouth, and feel your child's neck.\\nSince the adenoids are higher up than the throat, the provider cannot see them just by looking through your child's mouth.  To check the size of your child's adenoids, your provider may use:\\nA special mirror in the mouth\\nA long, flexible tube with a light (an endoscope)\\nAn x-ray\\n\\nWhat are the treatments for enlarged adenoids?\\nThe treatment depends on what is causing the problem. If the symptoms are not too bad, your child may not need treatment. If treatment is needed, your child may get nasal spray to reduce the swelling or antibiotics if the provider thinks that there is a bacterial infection.\\nIn some cases, your child may need an adenoidectomy.\\nWhat is an adenoidectomy and why might I my child need one?\\nAn adenoidectomy is surgery to remove the adenoids. The provider may recommend this surgery if:\\nYour child has repeated infections of the adenoids. Sometimes the infections can also cause ear infections and fluid buildup in the middle ear.\\nAntibiotics can't get rid of a bacterial infection of the adenoids.\\nThe enlarged adenoids block the airways.\\n\\nIf there is also a problem with the tonsils, your child will probably have a tonsillectomy (removal of the tonsils) at the same time that the adenoids are removed.\\nAfter having the surgery, your child usually goes home the same day. Your child will probably have some throat pain, bad breath, and a runny nose. It can take several days to feel all better.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Platelet Disorders': '\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nPlatelets, also known as thrombocytes, are blood cells. They form in your bone marrow, a sponge-like tissue in your bones. Platelets play a major role in blood clotting. Normally, when one of your blood vessels is injured, you start to bleed. Your platelets will clot (clump together) to plug the hole in the blood vessel and stop the bleeding. You can have different problems with your platelets:\\n\\nIf your blood has a low number of platelets, it is called thrombocytopenia. This can put you at risk for mild to serious bleeding. The bleeding could be external or internal. There can be various causes. If the problem is mild, you may not need treatment. For more serious cases, you may need medicines or blood or platelet transfusions.\\nIf your blood has too many platelets, you may have a higher risk of blood clots.\\n\\nWhen the cause is unknown, this is called thrombocythemia. It is rare. You may not need treatment if there are no signs or symptoms. In other cases, people who have it may need treatment with medicines or procedures.\\nIf another disease or condition is causing the high platelet count, it is thrombocytosis. The treatment and outlook for thrombocytosis depends on what is causing it.\\n\\nAnother possible problem is that your platelets do not work as they should. For example, in von Willebrand Disease, your platelets cannot stick together or cannot attach to blood vessel walls. This can cause excessive bleeding. There are different types of in von Willebrand Disease; treatment depends on which type you have.\\n\\nNIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute\\n',\n",

       " 'Head Lice': '\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nWhat are head lice?\\nHead lice are tiny insects that live on people\\'s heads. Adult lice are about the size of sesame seeds. The eggs, called nits, are even smaller - about the size of a dandruff flake. Lice and nits are found on or near the scalp, most often at the neckline and behind the ears.\\nHead lice are parasites, and they need to feed on human blood to survive. They are one of the three types of lice that live on humans. The other two types are body lice and pubic lice. Each type of lice is different, and getting one type does not mean that you will get another type.\\nHow do head lice spread?\\nLice move by crawling, because they cannot hop or fly. They spread by close person-to-person contact. Rarely, they can spread through sharing personal belongings such as hats or hairbrushes. Personal hygiene and cleanliness have nothing to do with getting head lice. You also cannot get pubic lice from animals. Head lice do not spread disease.\\nWho is at risk for head lice?\\nChildren ages 3-11 and their families get head lice most often. This is because young children often have head-to-head contact while playing together.\\nWhat are the symptoms of head lice?\\nThe symptoms of head lice include:\\nTickling feeling in the hair\\nFrequent itching, which is caused by an allergic reaction to the bites\\nSores from scratching. Sometimes the sores can become infected with bacteria.\\nTrouble sleeping, because head lice are most active in the dark\\n\\nHow do you know if you have head lice?\\nA diagnosis of head lice usually comes from seeing a louse or nit. Because they are very small and move quickly, you may need to use a magnifying lens and a fine-toothed comb to find lice or nits.\\nWhat are the treatments for head lice?\\nTreatments for head lice include both over-the-counter and prescription shampoos, creams, and lotions. If you want to use an over-the-counter treatment and you aren\\'t sure which one to use or how to use one, ask your health care provider or pharmacist. You should also check with your health care provider first if you are pregnant or nursing, or if you want to use a treatment on a young child.\\nFollow these steps when using a head lice treatment:\\nApply the product according to the instructions. Only apply it to the scalp and the hair attached to the scalp. You should not use it on other body hair.\\nUse only one product at a time, unless your health care provider tells you to use two different kinds at once\\nPay attention to what the instructions say about how long you should leave the medicine on the hair and on how you should rinse it out\\nAfter rinsing, use a fine-toothed comb or special \"nit comb\" to remove dead lice and nits\\nAfter each treatment, check your hair for lice and nits.

       " 'Pregnancy and Opioids': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nMany women need to take medicines while they are pregnant. But not all medicines are safe during pregnancy. Many medicines carry risks for you, your baby, or both. Opioids, especially when misused, can cause problems for you and your baby while you are pregnant.\\nWhat are opioids?\\nOpioids, sometimes called narcotics, are a type of drug. They include strong prescription pain relievers, such as oxycodone, hydrocodone, fentanyl, and tramadol. The illegal drug heroin is also an opioid.\\nA health care provider may give you a prescription opioid to reduce pain after you have had a major injury or surgery. You may get them if you have severe pain from health conditions like cancer. Some health care providers prescribe them for chronic pain.\\nPrescription opioids used for pain relief are generally safe when taken for a short time and as prescribed by your health care provider. However, opioid dependence, addiction, and overdose are still potential risks. These risks increase when these medicines are misused. Misuse means you are not taking the medicines according to your provider's instructions, you are using them to get high, or you are taking someone else's opioids.\\nWhat are the risks of taking opioids during pregnancy?\\nTaking opioids during pregnancy can cause problems for you and your baby. The possible risks include:\\nNeonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) - withdrawal symptoms (irritability, seizures, vomiting, diarrhea, fever, and poor feeding) in newborns\\nNeural tube defects - birth defects of the brain, spine, or spinal cord\\nCongenital heart defects - problems with the structure of the baby's heart\\nGastroschisis - a birth defect of the baby's abdomen, where the intestines stick outside of the body through a hole beside the belly button\\nLoss of the baby, either miscarriage (before 20 weeks of pregnancy) or stillbirth (after 20 or more weeks)\\nPreterm delivery - a birth before 37 weeks\\nStunted growth, leading to low birthweight\\n\\nSome women need to take opioid pain medicine while they are pregnant. If your health care provider suggests that you take opioids during pregnancy, you should first discuss the risks and benefits. Then if you both decide that you need to take the opioids, you should work together to try to minimize the risks. Some of the ways to do this include:\\nTaking them for the shortest time possible\\nTaking the lowest dose that will help you\\nCarefully following your provider's instructions for taking the medicines\\nContacting your provider if you have side effects\\nGoing to all your follow-up appointments\\n\\nIf I am already taking opioids and I become pregnant, what should I do?\\nIf you have been taking opioids and you become pregnant, contact your health care provider. You should not stop taking the opioids on your own. If you suddenly stop taking opioids, it could cause severe health problems for you or your baby. In some cases, stopping suddenly during pregnancy may be more harmful than taking the medicines.\\nCan I breastfeed while taking opioids?\\nMany women who regularly take opioid medicines can breastfeed. It depends on which medicine you are taking. Check with your health care provider before breastfeeding.\\nThere are some women who should not breastfeed, such as those who have HIV or take illegal drugs.\\nWhat are the treatments for opioid use disorders in pregnancy?\\nIf you are pregnant and have an opioid use disorder, do not stop taking opioids suddenly. Instead, see your health care provider so you can get help. The treatment for opioid use disorder is medication-assisted therapy (MAT). MAT includes medicine and counseling:\\nMedicine can reduce your cravings and withdrawal symptoms. For pregnant women, health care providers use either buprenorphine or methadone.\\nCounseling, including behavioral therapies, which can help you\\n\\nChange your attitudes and behaviors related to drug use\\nBuild healthy life skills\\nContinue taking your medicine and getting prenatal care\\n\\n\\n\",\n",

       " 'Polio and Post-Polio Syndrome': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nWhat is polio? \\nPolio, or poliomyelitis, is a disease that spreads from person to person. It is caused by the poliovirus. The virus attacks the nervous system. In serious cases, it can cause paralysis (where you can't move parts of the body). The paralysis may be lifelong and can sometimes be life-threatening.\\nBecause of vaccines, polio is rare in the United States. But polio does occur in some parts of the world, and travelers can spread the virus.\\nHow does polio spread?\\nThe poliovirus is very contagious. It spreads through contact with:\\n\\nThe stool (poop) of person who has the infection\\nDroplets from a sneeze or cough of someone who has the infection\\n\\nThis contact can happen if:\\n\\nYou get contaminated stool or droplets on your hands and then touch your mouth\\nA child puts contaminated toys or other objects into their mouth\\nYou share food or utensils with someone who has the infection\\n\\nPeople who have the infection can spread it to others just before and up to several weeks after the symptoms appear. People who don't have symptoms can still spread the virus to others and make them sick.\\nWho is more likely to develop polio?\\nPolio mainly affects children under age 5. But people of any age (including adults) who are unvaccinated are at risk of developing polio. People who live in or travel to areas where there is polio are more likely to get polio.\\nWhat are the symptoms of polio?\\nMost people who get infected with poliovirus do not have any symptoms. But one out of four people who get polio will have flu-like symptoms. These symptoms usually last 2 to 5 days, and they include:\\n\\nSore throat\\nFever\\nFatigue\\nNausea\\nHeadache\\nStomach pain\\n\\nIn rare cases, polio can be very serious. It can lead to:\\n\\nMeningitis, an infection of the covering of your spinal cord and/or brain.\\nWeakness or paralysis in your arms, legs, or both. This paralysis or weakness can last a lifetime. It is possible for the paralysis to become life-threatening if it affects the muscles that you use to breathe.\\nPost-polio syndrome (PPS), which happens later in life.\\n\\nWhat is post-polio syndrome (PPS)?\\nPost-polio syndrome (PPS) is a condition that affects polio survivors many years after they recovered from polio. It usually happens 15-40 years later. It is not contagious.\\nPeople who get PPS start having new weakening in muscles that were previously affected by the polio infection.  Symptoms may range from mild to serious. The symptoms of PPS include:\\n\\nMuscle weakness\\nMuscle atrophy (wasting away of muscles)\\nLoss of muscle function\\nMental and physical fatigue\\nJoint pain\\nCurving of the spine (scoliosis)\\n\\nPPS is rarely life-threatening, but the symptoms can interfere with your daily life.\\nHow is polio diagnosed?\\nIf you think you or someone in your family has symptoms of polio, call your healthcare provider right away or go to an emergency room.\\nTo find out if you or your child has polio, the provider:\\n\\nWill do a physical exam.\\nWill take a detailed medical history, including your vaccination history and history of any recent travel.\\nWill collect samples of body fluids, such as stool, saliva, blood, urine, and spinal fluid. Poliovirus is most likely to be detected in stool specimens.\\nMay do an MRI to look at pictures of the spinal cord.\\n\\nWhat are the treatments for polio and post-polio syndrome (PPS)?\\nThere is no cure or specific treatment for polio. For a mild case, getting rest and drinking plenty of liquids may help with some of the symptoms.\\nIf the polio is more serious, you or your child may need:\\n\\nPhysical or occupational therapy to help with arm or leg weakness. The earlier therapy is started, the better. \\nPain relievers to help with pain and treat fever. If your child is sick, do not give them aspirin unless their provider tells you to.\\nA ventilator to help with breathing if the breathing muscles are weak or paralyzed.\\n\\nThere is no cure for PPS. Treatments may help you manage your symptoms. They include:\\n\\nNon-fatiguing exercises (exercises that do not cause pain or fatigue that lasts more than 10 minutes). These exercises may improve muscle strength and reduce tiredness. Your provider can help you figure out which exercises are best for you.\\nMobility aids.\\nVentilation equipment.\\nLifestyle changes, such as eating a healthy diet, getting enough sleep, and not smoking.\\n\\nCan polio be prevented?\\nThere are two types of vaccine that can prevent polio:\\n\\nInactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) given as an injection in the leg or arm, depending on how old you are. Since 2000, this has been the only polio vaccine used in the United States.\\nOral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) is given as drops in the mouth. It is still used throughout much of the world.\\n\\nChildren in the United States get four doses of PV as part of their routine childhood immunizations. Most adults in the United States were vaccinated against polio as children.\\nThere is a one-time IPV booster. It may be given to adults who have completed their polio vaccinations but are at higher risk of contact with poliovirus. You may be at higher risk if you are:\\n\\nTraveling to a country where the risk of getting polio is greater\\nWorking in a laboratory or healthcare setting and handling samples that might contain polioviruses\\nA healthcare worker who has contact with patients who could have polio\\n\\nAnother way to help prevent the spread of polio is to wash your hands often with soap and water. Alcohol-based hand sanitizers will not kill poliovirus.\\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention\\n\",\n",

They are at risk for health difficulties such as high blood pressure, kidney problems, diabetes, cataracts, osteoporosis, and thyroid problems.\\nDoctors diagnose Turner syndrome based on symptoms and a genetic test. Sometimes it is found in prenatal testing. There is no cure for Turner syndrome, but there are some treatments for the symptoms. Growth hormone often helps girls reach heights that are close to average. Hormone replacement can help start sexual development. Assisted reproduction techniques can help some women with Turner syndrome get pregnant.\\nNIH: National Institute of Child Health and Human Development\\n',\n",

       " 'Diverticulosis and Diverticulitis': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nDiverticula are small pouches that bulge outward through the colon, or large intestine. If you have these pouches, you have a condition called diverticulosis. It becomes more common as people age. About half of all people over age 60 have it. Doctors believe the main cause is a low-fiber diet.\\nMost people with diverticulosis don't have symptoms. Sometimes it causes mild cramps, bloating or constipation. Diverticulosis is often found through tests ordered for something else. For example, it is often found during a colonoscopy to screen for cancer. A high-fiber diet and mild pain reliever will often relieve symptoms.\\nIf the pouches become inflamed or infected, you have a condition called diverticulitis. The most common symptom is abdominal pain, usually on the left side. You may also have fever, nausea, vomiting, chills, cramping, and constipation. In serious cases, diverticulitis can lead to bleeding, tears, or blockages. Your doctor will do a physical exam and imaging tests to diagnose it. Treatment may include antibiotics, pain relievers, and a liquid diet.

       " 'Heart Attack': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nEach year almost 800,000 Americans have a heart attack. A heart attack happens when blood flow to the heart suddenly becomes blocked. Without the blood coming in, the heart can't get oxygen. If not treated quickly, the heart muscle begins to die. But if you do get quick treatment, you may be able to prevent or limit damage to the heart muscle. That's why it's important to know the symptoms of a heart attack and call 911 if you or someone else is having them. You should call, even if you are not sure that it is a heart attack.\\nThe most common symptoms in men and women are:\\nChest discomfort. It is often in center or left side of the chest. It usually lasts more than a few minutes. It may go away and come back. It can feel like pressure, squeezing, fullness, or pain. It also can feel like heartburn or indigestion.\\nShortness of breath. Sometimes this is your only symptom. You may get it before or during the chest discomfort. It can happen when you are resting or doing a little bit of physical activity.\\nDiscomfort in the upper body. You may feel pain or discomfort in one or both arms, the back, shoulders, neck, jaw, or upper part of the stomach.\\n\\nYou may also have other symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and lightheadedness. You may break out in a cold sweat. Sometimes women will have different symptoms then men. For example, they are more likely to feel tired for no reason.\\nThe most common cause of heart attacks is coronary artery disease (CAD). With CAD, there is a buildup of cholesterol and other material, called plaque, on their inner walls or the arteries. This is atherosclerosis. It can build up for years. Eventually an area of plaque can rupture (break open). A blood clot can form around the plaque and block the artery.\\nA less common cause of heart attack is a severe spasm (tightening) of a coronary artery. The spasm cuts off blood flow through the artery.\\nAt the hospital, health care providers make a diagnosis based on your symptoms, blood tests, and different heart health tests. Treatments may include medicines and medical procedures such as coronary angioplasty. After a heart attack, cardiac rehabilitation and lifestyle changes can help you recover.\\nNIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute\\n\",\n",

These include the Ebola and Marburg, Lassa fever, and yellow fever viruses. VHFs have common features: they affect many organs, they damage the blood vessels, and they affect the body's ability to regulate itself. Some VHFs cause mild disease, but some, like Ebola or Marburg, cause severe disease and death.\\nVHFs are found around the world. Specific diseases are usually limited to areas where the animals that carry them live. For example, Lassa fever is limited to rural areas of West Africa where rats and mice carry the virus.\\nThe risk for travelers is low, but you should avoid visiting areas where there are disease outbreaks.

       " 'Heart Failure': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nWhat is heart failure?\\nHeart failure means that your heart can't pump enough oxygen-rich blood to meet your body's needs. Heart failure doesn't mean that your heart has stopped or is about to stop beating. But without enough blood flow, your organs may not work well, which can cause serious problems.\\nHeart failure can affect one or both sides of your heart:\\n\\nWith right-sided heart failure, your heart is too weak to pump enough blood to your lungs to get oxygen.\\nWith left-sided heart failure, your heart can't pump enough oxygen-rich blood out to your body. This happens when the left side of your heart becomes either:\\n\\t\\nToo weak to pump enough blood.\\nToo thick or stiff to relax and fill with enough blood.\\n\\n\\n\\nLeft-sided heart failure is more common than right-sided heart failure.\\nWhat causes heart failure?\\nHeart failure can start suddenly after a medical condition or injury damages your heart muscle. But in most cases, heart failure develops slowly from long-term medical conditions.\\nConditions that can cause heart failure include:\\n\\nArrhythmia (a problem with the rate or rhythm of your heartbeat)\\nCardiomyopathy\\nCongenital heart defects or other types of heart diseases that you are born with\\nCoronary artery disease\\nEndocarditis\\nHeart attack\\nHeart valve diseases\\nHigh blood pressure\\nA blood clot in your lung\\nDiabetes\\nCertain severe lung diseases, such as COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease)\\nObesity\\n\\nOver time, left-sided heart failure can lead to right-sided heart failure.\\nWho is more likely to develop heart failure?\\nHeart failure can happen at any age. It happens to both men and women, but men often develop it at a younger age than women.  Your chance of developing heart failure increases if:\\n\\nYou're 65 years old or older. Aging can weaken and stiffen your heart muscle.\\nYour family health history includes relatives who have or have had heart failure.\\nYou have changes in your genes that affect your heart tissue.\\nYou have habits that can harm your heart, including:\\n\\t\\nSmoking.\\nEating foods high in fat, cholesterol, and sodium (salt).\\nHaving an inactive lifestyle.\\nAlcohol use disorder (AUD).\\nIllegal drug use.\\n\\n\\nYou have other medical conditions that can affect your heart, including: \\n\\t\\nAny heart or blood vessel conditions, including high blood pressure.\\nSerious lung diseases.\\nInfection, such as HIV/AIDS or COVID-19.\\nObesity.\\nDiabetes. \\nSleep apnea.\\nChronic kidney disease.\\nAnemia.\\nIron overload disease.\\nCancer treatments that can harm your heart, such as radiation and chemotherapy.\\n\\n\\nYou are African American. African Americans are more likely to develop heart failure and have more serious cases at younger ages than people of other races. Factors such as stigma, discrimination, income, education, and geographic region can also affect their risk of heart failure.\\n\\nWhat are the symptoms of heart failure?\\nThe symptoms of heart failure depend on which side of your heart is affected and how serious your condition has become.  Most symptoms are caused by reduced blood flow to your organs and fluid buildup in your body.\\nFluid buildup happens because the flow of blood through your heart is too slow. As a result, blood backs up in the vessels that return the blood to your heart. Fluid may leak from the blood vessels and collect in the tissues of your body, causing swelling (edema) and other problems.\\nSymptoms of heart failure may include:\\n\\nFeeling short of breath (like you can't get enough air) when you do things like climbing stairs.

For example, you could get germs if someone who is sick touched a door handle, and then you touch it.\\nThrough insect or animal bites\\nThrough contaminated food, water, soil, or plants\\n\\nThere are four main kinds of germs:\\n\\nBacteria - one-celled germs that multiply quickly. They may give off toxins, which are harmful chemicals that can make you sick. Strep throat and urinary tract infections are common bacterial infections.\\nViruses - tiny capsules that contain genetic material. They invade your cells so that they can multiply. This can kill, damage, or change the cells and make you sick. Viral infections include HIV/AIDS and the common cold.\\nFungi - primitive plant-like organisms such as mushrooms, mold, mildew, and yeasts. Athlete's foot is a common fungal infection.\\nParasites - animals or plants that survive by living on or in other living things. Malaria is an infection caused by a parasite.\\n\\nInfectious diseases can cause many different symptoms. Some are so mild that you may not even notice any symptoms, while others can be life-threatening. There are treatments for some infectious diseases, but for others, such as some viruses, you can only treat your symptoms. You can take steps to prevent many infectious diseases:\\n\\nGet vaccinated\\nWash your hands often\\nPay attention to food safety\\nAvoid contact with wild animals\\nPractice safe sex\\nDon't share items such as toothbrushes, combs, and straws\\n\\n\",\n",
       " 'Vaccines': '\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nWhat are vaccines?\\nVaccines are injections (shots), liquids, pills, or nasal sprays that you take to teach your body\\'s immune system to recognize and defend against harmful germs. For example, there are vaccines to protect against diseases caused by:\\nViruses, like the ones that cause the flu and COVID-19\\nBacteria, including tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis\\n\\nWhat are the types of vaccines?\\nThere are several types of vaccines:\\nLive-attenuated vaccines use a weakened form of the germ.\\nInactivated vaccines use a killed version of the germ.\\nSubunit, recombinant, polysaccharide, and conjugate vaccines use only specific pieces of the germ, such as its protein, sugar, or casing.\\nToxoid vaccines that use a toxin (harmful product) made by the germ.\\nmRNA vaccines use messenger RNA, which gives your cells instructions for how to make a protein (or piece of a protein) of the germ.\\nViral vector vaccines use genetic material, which gives your cells instructions for making a protein of the germ. These vaccines also contain a different, harmless virus that helps get the genetic material into your cells.\\n\\nVaccines work in different ways, but they all spark an immune response. The immune response is the way your body defends itself against substances it sees as foreign or harmful. These substances include germs that can cause disease.\\nWhat happens in an immune response?\\nThere are different steps in the immune response:\\nWhen a germ invades, your body sees it as foreign.\\nYour immune system helps your body fight off the germ.\\nYour immune system also remembers the germ. It will attack the germ if it ever invades again. This \"memory\" protects you against the disease that the germ causes. This type of protection is called immunity.\\n\\nWhat are immunization and vaccination?\\nImmunization is the process of becoming protected against a disease. But it can also mean the same thing as vaccination, which is getting a vaccine to become protected against a disease.\\nWhy are vaccines important?\\nVaccines are important because they protect you against many diseases. These diseases can be very serious. So getting immunity from a vaccine is safer than getting immunity by being sick with the disease. And for a few vaccines, getting vaccinated can actually give you a better immune response than getting the disease would.\\nBut vaccines don\\'t just protect you. They also protect the people around you through community immunity.\\nWhat is community immunity?\\nCommunity immunity, or herd immunity, is the idea that vaccines can help keep communities healthy.\\nNormally, germs can travel quickly through a community and make a lot of people sick. If enough people get sick, it can lead to an outbreak. But when enough people are vaccinated against a certain disease, it\\'s harder for that disease to spread to others. This type of protection means that the entire community is less likely to get the disease.\\nCommunity immunity is especially important for people who can\\'t get certain vaccines. For example, they may not be able to get a vaccine because they have weakened immune systems. Others may be allergic to certain vaccine ingredients. And newborn babies are too young to get some vaccines. Community immunity can help to protect them all.\\nAre vaccines safe?\\nVaccines are safe. They must go through extensive safety testing and evaluation before they are approved in the United States.\\nWhat is a vaccine schedule?\\nA vaccine, or immunization, schedule lists which vaccines are recommended for different groups of people. It includes who should get the vaccines, how many doses they need, and when they should get them. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) publishes the vaccine schedule.\\nIt\\'s important for both children and adults to get their vaccines according to the schedule. Following the schedule allows them to get protection from the diseases at exactly the right time.\\n',\n",
       " 'Tooth Decay': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nWhat is tooth decay?\\nTooth decay is damage to a tooth's surface, or enamel. It happens when bacteria in your mouth make acids that attack the enamel. Tooth decay can lead to cavities (dental caries), which are holes in your teeth. If tooth decay is not treated, it can cause pain, infection, and even tooth loss.\\nWhat causes tooth decay?\\nOur mouths are full of bacteria. Some bacteria are helpful. But some can be harmful, including the ones that play a role in tooth decay. These bacteria combine with food to form a soft, sticky film called plaque. The bacteria in plaque use the sugar and starch in what you eat and drink to make acids. The acids begin to eat away at the minerals on your enamel. Over time, the plaque can harden into tartar. Besides damaging your teeth, plaque and tartar can also irritate your gums and cause gum disease.\\nYou get fluoride from toothpaste, water, and other sources. This fluoride, along with your salvia, helps the enamel repair itself by replacing the minerals. Your teeth go through this natural process of losing minerals and regaining minerals all day long. But if you don't take care of your teeth and/or you eat and drink lots of sugary or starchy things, your enamel will keep losing minerals. This leads to tooth decay.\\nA white spot may appear where minerals have been lost. This is an early sign of tooth decay. You may be able to stop or reverse the decay at this point. Your enamel can still repair itself, if you take better care of your teeth and limit sugary/starchy foods and drinks.\\nBut if the tooth decay process continues, more minerals are lost. Over time, the enamel is weakened and destroyed, forming a cavity. A cavity is a hole in your tooth. It is permanent damage that a dentist has to repair with a filling.\\nWho is at risk for tooth decay?\\nThe main risk factors for tooth decay are not taking care of your teeth and having too many sugary or starchy foods and drinks.\\nSome people have a higher risk of tooth decay, including people who:\\nDon't have enough saliva, because of medicines, certain diseases, or some cancer treatments\\nDon't get enough fluoride\\nAre very young. Babies and toddlers who drink from bottles are at risk, especially if they are given juice or get bottles at bedtime. This exposes their teeth to sugars for long periods of time.\\nAre older. Many older adults have receding gums and more wear on their teeth. These raise the risk of decay on the exposed root surfaces of their teeth.\\n\\nWhat are the symptoms of tooth decay and cavities?\\nIn early tooth decay, you usually don't have symptoms. As tooth decay gets worse, it can cause:\\nA toothache (tooth pain)\\nTooth sensitivity to sweets, hot, or cold\\nWhite or brown stains on the surface of a tooth\\nA cavity\\nAn infection, which can lead to an abscess (pocket of pus) forming. The abscess can cause pain, facial swelling, and fever.\\n\\nHow are tooth decay and cavities diagnosed?\\nDentists usually find tooth decay and cavities by looking at your teeth and probing them with dental instruments. Your dentist will also ask if you have any symptoms. Sometimes you may need a dental x-ray.\\nWhat are the treatments for tooth decay and cavities?\\nThere are several treatments for tooth decay and cavities. Which treatment you get depends on how bad the problem is:\\nFluoride treatments. If you have early tooth decay, a fluoride treatment can help the enamel to repair itself.\\nFillings. If you have a typical cavity, your dentist will remove the decayed tooth tissue and then restore the tooth by filling it with a filling material.\\nRoot canal. If the damage to the tooth and/or an infection spreads to the pulp (inside of the tooth), you might need a root canal. Your dentist will remove the decayed pulp and clean inside the tooth and root. The next step is to fill the tooth with a temporary filling. Then you will need to come back to get a permanent filling or a crown (a cover on the tooth).\\nExtraction (pulling the tooth). In the most severe cases, when the damage to the pulp cannot be fixed, your dentist may pull the tooth. Your dentist will suggest that you get a bridge or implant to replace the missing tooth. Otherwise, the teeth next to the gap may move over and change your bite.\\n\\nCan tooth decay be prevented?\\nThere are steps that you can take to prevent tooth decay:\\nMake sure that you get enough fluoride by\\n\\t\\nBrushing with a fluoride toothpaste\\nDrinking tap water with fluoride. Most bottled water does not contain fluoride.\\nUsing fluoride mouth rinse\\n\\n\\nPractice good oral health by brushing your teeth twice a day with a fluoride toothpaste and regularly flossing your teeth\\nMake smart food choices by limiting foods and drinks that are high in sugars and starches. Eat nutritious, balanced meals and limit snacking.\\nDo not use tobacco products, including smokeless tobacco. If you currently use tobacco, consider quitting.\\nSee a dentist for regular check-ups and professional cleanings\\nMake sure that your children get sealants on their teeth. Dental sealants are thin plastic coatings that protect the chewing surfaces of the back teeth. Children should get sealants on their back teeth as soon as they come in, before decay can attack the teeth.\\n\\nNIH: National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research\\n\",\n",
       " 'Sarcoidosis': '\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nSarcoidosis is a disease that leads to inflammation, usually in your lungs, skin, or lymph nodes. It starts as tiny, grain-like lumps, called granulomas. Sarcoidosis can affect any organ in your body. \\nNo one is sure what causes sarcoidosis. It affects men and women of all ages and races.  It occurs mostly in people ages 20 to 50, African Americans, especially women, and people of Northern European origin.\\nMany people have no symptoms. If you have symptoms, they may include:\\nCough\\nShortness of breath\\nWeight loss\\nNight sweats\\nFatigue\\n\\nTests to diagnose sarcoidosis include chest x-rays, lung function tests, and a biopsy. Not everyone who has the disease needs treatment. If you do, prednisone, a type of steroid, is the main treatment.\\nNIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute\\n',\n",

       " 'Radiation Therapy': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nRadiation therapy is a cancer treatment. It uses high doses of radiation to kill cancer cells and stop them from spreading. About half of all cancer patients receive it. The radiation may be external, from special machines, or internal, from radioactive substances that a doctor places inside your body. The type of radiation therapy you receive depends on many factors, including:\\nThe type of cancer\\nThe size of the cancer\\nThe cancer's location in the body\\nHow close the cancer is to normal tissues that are sensitive to radiation\\nHow far into the body the radiation needs to travel\\nYour general health and medical history\\nWhether you will have other types of cancer treatment\\nOther factors, such as your age and other medical conditions\\n\\nRadiation therapy can damage normal cells as well as cancer cells. Treatment must be carefully planned to minimize side effects. Common side effects include skin changes and fatigue. Other side effects depend on the part of your body being treated.\\nSometimes radiation is used with other treatments, like surgery or chemotherapy. \\nNIH: National Cancer Institute\\n\",\n",
       " 'Assisted Reproductive Technology': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nAssisted reproductive technology (ART) is used to treat infertility. It includes fertility treatments that handle both eggs and sperm. It works by removing eggs from the ovaries. The eggs are then mixed with sperm to make embryos. The embryos are then put back in the parent's body. In vitro fertilization (IVF) is the most common and effective type of ART.\\nART procedures sometimes use donor eggs, donor sperm, or previously frozen embryos. It may also involve a surrogate or gestational carrier. A surrogate is a person who becomes pregnant with sperm from one partner of the couple. A gestational carrier becomes pregnant with an egg from one partner and sperm from the other partner.\\nThe most common complication of ART is a multiple pregnancy. It can be prevented or minimized by limiting the number of embryos that are put into the parent's body. \\n\",\n",
       " 'Osteonecrosis': '\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nOsteonecrosis is a disease caused by reduced blood flow to bones in the joints. In people with healthy bones, new bone is always replacing old bone. In osteonecrosis, the lack of blood causes the bone to break down faster than the body can make enough new bone. The bone starts to die and may break down.\\nYou can have osteonecrosis in one or several bones. It is most common in the upper leg. Other common sites are your upper arm and your knees, shoulders and ankles. The disease can affect men and women of any age, but it usually strikes in your thirties, forties or fifties. \\nAt first, you might not have any symptoms. As the disease gets worse, you will probably have joint pain that becomes more severe. You may not be able to bend or move the affected joint very well. \\nNo one is sure what causes the disease. Risk factors include :\\n\\tLong-term steroid treatment\\n\\tAlcohol misuse\\n\\tJoint injuries\\n\\tHaving certain diseases, including arthritis and cancer  \\n\\nDoctors use imaging tests and other tests to diagnose osteonecrosis. Treatments include medicines, using crutches, limiting activities that put weight on the affected joints, electrical stimulation and surgery.\\nNIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases\\n',\n",
       " 'Esophageal Cancer': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nThe esophagus is a hollow tube that carries food and liquids from your throat to your stomach.  Early esophageal cancer usually does not cause symptoms. Later, you may have symptoms such as:\\nPainful or difficult swallowing\\nWeight loss\\nA hoarse voice or cough that doesn't go away\\n\\nYou're at greater risk for getting esophageal cancer if you smoke, drink heavily, or have acid reflux. Your risk also goes up as you age\\n Your doctor uses imaging tests and a biopsy to diagnose esophageal cancer.  Treatments include surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy.  You might also need nutritional support, since the cancer or treatment may make it hard to swallow.\\nNIH: National Cancer Institute\\n\",\n",
       " 'Multiple Myeloma': '\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nMultiple myeloma is a cancer that begins in plasma cells, a type of white blood cell. These cells are part of your immune system, which helps protect the body from germs and other harmful substances. In time, myeloma cells collect in the bone marrow and in the solid parts of bones.\\nNo one knows the exact causes of multiple myeloma, but it is more common in older people and African Americans. It can run in families. Common symptoms may include:\\nBone pain, often in the back or ribs\\nFractures (broken bones)\\nWeakness or fatigue\\nWeight loss\\nFrequent infections and fevers\\nFeeling very thirsty\\nFrequent urination\\n\\nDoctors diagnose multiple myeloma using lab tests, imaging tests, and a bone marrow biopsy.  Your treatment depends on how advanced the disease is and whether you have symptoms.  If you have no symptoms, you may not need treatment right away. If you have symptoms, you may have chemotherapy, stem cell transplantation, radiation, or targeted therapy. Targeted therapy uses drugs or other substances that attack specific cancer cells with less harm to normal cells.\\nNIH: National Cancer Institute\\n',\n",

       " 'Flu': '\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nWhat is the flu?\\nThe flu, also called influenza, is a respiratory infection caused by viruses. Each year, millions of Americans get sick with the flu. Sometimes it causes mild illness. But it can also be serious or even deadly, especially for people over 65, newborn babies, and people with certain chronic illnesses.\\nWhat causes the flu?\\nThe flu is caused by flu viruses that spread from person to person. When someone with the flu coughs, sneezes, or talks, they spray tiny droplets. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby. Less often, a person may get flu by touching a surface or object that has flu virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes.\\nWhat are the symptoms of the flu?\\nSymptoms of the flu come on suddenly and may include:\\nFever or feeling feverish/chills\\nCough\\nSore throat\\nRunny or stuffy nose\\nMuscle or body aches\\nHeadaches\\nFatigue (tiredness)\\n\\nSome people may also have vomiting and diarrhea. This is more common in children.\\nSometimes people have trouble figuring out whether they have a cold or the flu.

For example, \"stomach flu\" isn\\'t the flu; it\\'s gastroenteritis.\\nWhat other problems can the flu cause?\\nSome people who get the flu will develop complications. Some of these complications can be serious or even life-threatening. They include:\\nBronchitis\\nEar infection\\nSinus infection\\nPneumonia\\nInflammation of the heart (myocarditis), brain (encephalitis), or muscle tissues (myositis, rhabdomyolysis)\\n\\nThe flu also can make chronic health problems worse. For example, people with asthma may have asthma attacks while they have flu.\\nCertain people are more likely to have complications from the flu, including:\\nAdults 65 and older\\nPregnant women\\nChildren younger than 5\\nPeople with certain chronic health conditions, such as asthma, diabetes, and heart disease\\n\\nHow is the flu diagnosed?\\nTo diagnose the flu, health care providers will first do a medical history and ask about your symptoms. There are several tests for the flu. For the tests, your provider will swipe the inside of your nose or the back of your throat with a swab. Then the swab will be tested for the flu virus.\\nSome tests are quick and give results in 15-20 minutes. But these tests are not as accurate as other flu tests. These other tests can give you the results in one hour or several hours.\\nWhat are the treatments for the flu?\\nMost people with the flu recover on their own without medical care. People with mild cases of the flu should stay home and avoid contact with others, except to get medical care.\\nBut if you have symptoms of flu and are in a high risk group or are very sick or worried about your illness, contact your health care provider. You might need antiviral medicines to treat your flu. Antiviral medicines can make the illness milder and shorten the time you are sick. They also can prevent serious flu complications. They usually work best when you start taking them within 2 days of getting sick.\\nCan the flu be prevented?\\nThe best way to prevent the flu is to get flu vaccine every year. But it\\'s also important to have good health habits like covering your cough and washing your hands often. This can help stop the spread of germs and prevent the flu.\\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention\\n',\n",
       " 'Smoking': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nWhat are the health effects of smoking?\\nThere's no way around it; smoking is bad for your health. It harms nearly every organ of the body, some that you would not expect. Cigarette smoking causes nearly one in five deaths in the United States. It can also cause many other cancers and health problems. These include:\\nCancers, including lung and oral cancers\\nLung diseases, such as COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease)\\nDamage to and thickening of blood vessels, which causes high blood pressure\\nBlood clots and stroke\\nVision problems, such as cataracts and macular degeneration (AMD)\\n\\nWomen who smoke while pregnant have a greater chance of certain pregnancy problems.   Their babies are also at higher risk of dying of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).\\nSmoking also causes addiction to nicotine, a stimulant drug that is in tobacco. Nicotine addiction makes it much harder for people to quit smoking.\\nWhat are the health risks of secondhand smoke?\\nYour smoke is also bad for other people - they breathe in your smoke secondhand and can get many of the same problems as smokers do. This includes heart disease and lung cancer. Children exposed to secondhand smoke have a higher risk of ear infections, colds, pneumonia, bronchitis, and more severe asthma. Mothers who breathe secondhand smoke while pregnant are more likely to have preterm labor and babies with low birth weight.\\nAre other forms of tobacco also dangerous?\\nBesides cigarettes, there are several other forms of tobacco. Some people smoke tobacco in cigars and water pipes (hookahs). These forms of tobacco also contain harmful chemicals and nicotine. Some cigars contain as much tobacco as an entire pack of cigarettes.\\nE-cigarettes often look like cigarettes, but they work differently. They are battery-operated smoking devices. Using an e-cigarette is called vaping. Not much is known about the health risks of using them. We do know they contain nicotine, the same addictive substance in tobacco cigarettes. E-cigarettes also expose non-smokers to secondhand aerosols (rather than secondhand smoke), which contain harmful chemicals.\\nSmokeless tobacco, such as chewing tobacco and snuff, is also bad for your health. Smokeless tobacco can cause certain cancers, including oral cancer. It also increases your risk of getting heart disease, gum disease, and oral lesions.\\nWhy should I quit?\\nRemember, there is no safe level of tobacco use. Smoking even just one cigarette per day over a lifetime can cause smoking-related cancers and premature death. Quitting smoking can reduce your risk of health problems. The earlier you quit, the greater the benefit. Some immediate benefits of quitting include:\\nLower heart rate and blood pressure\\nLess carbon monoxide in the blood (carbon monoxide reduces the blood's ability to carry oxygen)\\nBetter circulation\\nLess coughing and wheezing\\n\\nNIH National Cancer Institute\\n\",\n",
       " 'Blood Clots': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nWhat is a blood clot?\\nA blood clot is mass of blood that forms when platelets, proteins, and cells in the blood stick together. When you get hurt, your body forms a blood clot to stop the bleeding.  After the bleeding stops and healing takes place, your body usually breaks down and removes the blood clot. But sometimes the blood clots form where they shouldn't, your body makes too many blood clots or abnormal blood clots, or the blood clots don't break down like they should. These blood clots can be dangerous and may cause other health problems.\\nBlood clots can form in, or travel to, the blood vessels in the limbs, lungs, brain, heart, and kidneys. The types of problems blood clots can cause will depend on where they are:\\nDeep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a blood clot in a deep vein, usually in the lower leg, thigh, or pelvis. It can block a vein and cause damage to your leg.\\nA pulmonary embolism can happen when a DVT breaks off and travels through the bloodstream to the lungs. It can damage your lungs and prevent your other organs from getting enough oxygen.\\nCerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) is a rare blood clot in the venous sinuses in your brain. Normally the venous sinuses drain blood from your brain. CVST blocks the blood from draining and can cause a hemorrhagic stroke.\\nBlood clots in other parts of the body can cause problems such as an ischemic stroke, a heart attack, kidney problems, kidney failure, and pregnancy-related problems.\\n\\nWho is at risk for blood clots?\\nCertain factors can raise the risk of blood clots:\\nAtherosclerosis\\nAtrial fibrillation\\nCancer and cancer treatments\\nCertain genetic disorders\\nCertain surgeries\\nCOVID-19\\nDiabetes\\nFamily history of blood clots\\nOverweight and obesity\\nPregnancy and giving birth\\nSerious injuries\\nSome medicines, including birth control pills\\nSmoking\\nStaying in one position for a long time, such as being in the hospital or taking a long car or plane ride\\n\\nWhat are the symptoms of blood clots?\\nThe symptoms for blood clots can be different, depending on where the blood clot is:\\nIn the abdomen: Abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting\\nIn an arm or leg: Sudden or gradual pain, swelling, tenderness, and warmth\\nIn the lungs: Shortness of breath, pain with deep breathing, rapid breathing, and increased heart rate\\nIn the brain: Trouble speaking, vision problems, seizures, weakness on one side of the body, and sudden severe headache\\nIn the heart: Chest pain, sweating, shortness of breath, and pain in the left arm\\n\\nHow are blood clots diagnosed?\\nYour health care provider may use many tools to diagnose blood clots:\\nA physical exam\\nA medical history\\nBlood tests, including a D-dimer test\\nImaging tests, such as\\n    \\nUltrasound\\nX-rays of the veins (venography) or blood vessels (angiography) that are taken after you get an injection of special dye. The dye shows up on the x-ray and allows the provider to see how the blood flows.\\nCT Scan\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat are the treatments for blood clots?\\nTreatments for blood clots depend on where the blood clot is located and how severe it is. Treatments may include:\\nBlood thinners\\nOther medicines, including thrombolytics. Thrombolytics are medicines which dissolve blood clots. They are usually used where the blood clots are severe.\\nSurgery and other procedures to remove the blood clots\\n\\nCan blood clots be prevented?\\nYou may be able to help prevent blood clots by:\\nMoving around as soon as possible after having been confined to your bed, such as after surgery, illness, or injury\\nGetting up and moving around every few hours when you have to sit for long periods of time, for example if you are on a long flight or car trip\\nRegular physical activity\\nNot smoking\\nStaying at a healthy weight\\n\\nSome people at high risk may need to take blood thinners to prevent blood clots.\\n\",\n",

The problems could include :\\nAbnormal facial features, such as a smooth ridge between the nose and upper lip\\nSmall head size\\nShorter-than-average height\\nLow body weight\\nPoor coordination\\nHyperactive behavior\\nDifficulty with attention and memory\\nLearning disabilities and difficulty in school\\nSpeech and language delays\\nIntellectual disability or low IQ\\nPoor reasoning and judgment skills\\nSleep and sucking problems as a baby\\nVision or hearing problems\\nProblems with the heart, kidneys, or bones\\n\\nFetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is the most serious type of FASD. People with fetal alcohol syndrome have facial abnormalities, including wide-set and narrow eyes, growth problems and nervous system abnormalities.\\nDiagnosing FASD can be hard because there is no medical test, like a blood test, for it. The health care provider will make a diagnosis by looking at the child\\'s signs and symptoms and asking whether the mother drank alcohol during pregnancy.\\nFASDs last a lifetime. There is no cure for FASDs, but treatments can help. These include medicines to help with some symptoms, medical care for health problems, behavior and education therapy, and parent training. A good treatment plan is specific to the child\\'s problems. It should include close monitoring, follow-ups, and changes when needed.\\nCertain \"protective factors\" can help reduce the effects of FASDs and help people who have them reach their full potential. They include:\\nDiagnosis before 6 years of age\\nLoving, nurturing, and stable home environment during the school years\\nAbsence of violence around them\\nInvolvement in special education and social services\\n\\nThere is no known safe amount of alcohol during pregnancy. To prevent FASDs, you should not drink alcohol while you are pregnant, or when you might get pregnant.\\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention\\n',\n",
       " 'Skin Aging': '\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nYour skin changes as you age. You might notice wrinkles, age spots and dryness. Your skin also becomes thinner and loses fat, making it less plump and smooth. It might take longer to heal, too. \\nSunlight is a major cause of skin aging. You can protect yourself by staying out of the sun when it is strongest, using sunscreen with an SPF of 15 or higher, wearing protective clothing, and avoiding sunlamps and tanning beds. Cigarette smoking also contributes to wrinkles. The wrinkling increases with the amount of cigarettes and number of years a person has smoked.\\nMany products claim to revitalize aging skin or reduce wrinkles, but the Food and Drug Administration has approved only a few for sun-damaged or aging skin. Various treatments soothe dry skin and reduce the appearance of age spots.\\nNIH: National Institute on Aging\\n',\n",
       " 'Bile Duct Cancer': '\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nYour liver makes a digestive juice called bile. Your gallbladder stores it between meals. When you eat, your gallbladder pushes the bile into tubes called bile ducts. They carry the bile to your small intestine. The bile helps break down fat. It also helps the liver get rid of toxins and wastes.\\nBile duct cancer is rare. It can happen in the parts of the bile ducts that are outside or inside the liver. Cancer of the bile duct outside of the liver is much more common. Risk factors include having inflammation of the bile duct, ulcerative colitis, and some liver diseases.\\nSymptoms can include:\\nJaundice\\nItchy skin\\nFever\\nAbdominal pain\\n\\nTests to diagnose bile duct cancer may include a physical exam, imaging tests of the liver and bile ducts, blood tests, and a biopsy.\\nTreatments include surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy.\\nNIH: National Cancer Institute\\n',\n",

They can grow in your brain and spinal cord, kidneys, pancreas, adrenal glands, and reproductive tract. The tumors are usually benign (non-cancerous). But some tumors, such as those in the kidney and pancreas, can become cancerous.\\nWhat causes Von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHL)?\\nVon Hippel-Lindau disease (VHL) is a genetic disease. It is inherited, which means that it is passed down from parent to child.\\nWhat are the symptoms of Von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHL)?\\nSymptoms of VHL depend on the size and location of the tumors. They may include:\\nHeadaches\\nProblems with balance and walking\\nDizziness\\nWeakness of the limbs\\nVision problems\\nHigh blood pressure\\n\\nHow is Von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHL) diagnosed?\\nDetecting and treating VHL early is important. Your health care provider may suspect that you have VHL if you have certain patterns of cysts and tumors. There is a genetic test for VHL. If you have it, you will need other tests, including imaging tests, to look for tumors and cysts.\\nWhat are the treatments for Von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHL)?\\nTreatment can vary, depending on the location and size of the tumors and cysts. It usually involves surgery. Certain tumors may be treated with radiation therapy. The goal is to treat growths while they are small and before they do permanent damage. You will need to have careful monitoring by a doctor and/or medical team familiar with the disorder.\\nNIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke\\n',\n",
       " 'Mastectomy': '\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nA mastectomy is surgery to remove a breast or part of a breast. It is usually done to treat breast cancer.  Types of breast surgery include:\\nTotal (simple) mastectomy - removal of breast tissue and nipple\\nModified radical mastectomy - removal of the breast, most of the lymph nodes under the arm, and often the lining over the chest muscles\\nLumpectomy - surgery to remove the tumor and a small amount of normal tissue around it\\n\\nWhich surgery you have depends on the stage of cancer, size of the tumor, size of the breast, and whether the lymph nodes are involved. Many women have breast reconstruction to rebuild the breast after a mastectomy.\\nSometimes mastectomy is done to prevent breast cancer. Only high-risk patients have this type of surgery.\\nNIH: National Cancer Institute\\n',\n",

Child abuse can be physical, sexual or emotional. Neglect, or not providing for a child's needs, is also a \\nform of abuse. \\nMost abused children suffer greater emotional than physical damage. An abused child may \\nbecome depressed. He or she may withdraw, think of suicide or become violent. An older \\nchild may use drugs or alcohol, try to run away or abuse others. \\nChild abuse is a serious problem. If you suspect a child is being abused or neglected, \\ncall the police or your local child welfare agency.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " 'Medicines and Children': '\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nChildren aren\\'t just small adults. It is especially important to remember this when giving medicines to children. Giving a child the wrong dose or a medicine that is not for children can have serious side effects.\\nThe drug labels for prescription medicines have a section on \"Pediatric Use.\" It says whether the medicine has been studied for its effects on children. It also tells you which age groups were studied. Some over-the-counter (OTC) medicines, like those that treat fever and pain, have been studied for effectiveness, safety, or dosing in children.  But many other OTC medicines have not. It is important to read the labels carefully, to make sure that the medicine is right for your child.\\nHere are some other tips for giving medicine safely to your child:\\n\\nRead and follow the label directions every time. Pay special attention to usage directions and warnings.\\nWatch out for problems. Contact your health care provider or pharmacist right away if\\n\\nYou notice any new symptoms or unexpected side effects in your child\\nThe medicine doesn\\'t appear to be working when you expect it to. For example, antibiotics may take a few days to start working, but a pain reliever usually starts working soon after your child takes it.\\n\\nKnow the abbreviations for the amounts of medicines:\\n\\nTablespoon (tbsp.)\\nTeaspoon (tsp.)\\nMilligram (mg.)\\nMilliliter (mL.)\\nOunce (oz.)\\n\\nUse the correct dosing device. If the label says two teaspoons and you\\'re using a dosing cup with ounces only, don\\'t try to guess how many teaspoons it would be. Get the proper measuring device. Don\\'t substitute another item, such as a kitchen spoon.\\nCheck with your health care provider or pharmacist before giving two medicines at the same time. That way, you can avoid a possible overdose or an unwanted interaction.\\nFollow age and weight limit recommendations. If the label says don\\'t give to children under a certain age or weight, then don\\'t do it.\\nAlways use the child-resistant cap and re-lock the cap after each use. Also, keep all medicines out of the reach of children.\\nAsk your health care provider or pharmacist if you have any questions.\\n\\nFood and Drug Administration\\n',\n",
       " 'Vitamin D Deficiency': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nWhat is vitamin D deficiency?\\nVitamin D deficiency means that you are not getting enough vitamin D to stay healthy.\\nWhy do I need vitamin D and how do I get it?\\nVitamin D helps your body absorb calcium. Calcium is one of the main building blocks of bone. Vitamin D also has a role in your nervous, muscle, and immune systems.\\nYou can get vitamin D in three ways: through your skin, from your diet, and from supplements. Your body forms vitamin D naturally after exposure to sunlight. But too much sun exposure can lead to skin aging and skin cancer, so many people try to get their vitamin D from other sources.\\nHow much vitamin D do I need?\\nThe amount of vitamin D you need each day depends on your age.  The recommended amounts, in international units (IU), are:\\nBirth to 12 months: 400 IU\\nChildren 1-13 years: 600 IU\\nTeens 14-18 years: 600 IU\\nAdults 19-70 years: 600 IU\\nAdults 71 years and older: 800 IU\\nPregnant and breastfeeding women: 600 IU\\n\\nPeople at high risk of vitamin D deficiency may need more. Check with your health care provider about how much you need.\\nWhat causes vitamin D deficiency?\\nYou can become deficient in vitamin D for different reasons:\\nYou don't get enough vitamin D in your diet\\nYou don't absorb enough vitamin D from food (a malabsorption problem)\\nYou don't get enough exposure to sunlight.\\nYour liver or kidneys cannot convert vitamin D to its active form in the body.\\nYou take medicines that interfere with your body's ability to convert or absorb vitamin D\\n\\nWho is at risk of vitamin D deficiency?\\nSome people are at higher risk of vitamin D deficiency:\\nBreastfed infants, because human milk is a poor source of vitamin D. If you are breastfeeding, give your infant a supplement of 400 IU of vitamin D every day.\\nOlder adults, because your skin doesn't make vitamin D when exposed to sunlight as efficiently as when you were young, and your kidneys are less able to convert vitamin D to its active form.\\nPeople with dark skin, which has less ability to produce vitamin D from the sun.\\nPeople with disorders such as Crohn's disease or celiac disease who don't handle fat properly, because vitamin D needs fat to be absorbed.\\nPeople who have obesity, because their body fat binds to some vitamin D and prevents it from getting into the blood.\\nPeople who have had gastric bypass surgery\\nPeople with osteoporosis\\nPeople with chronic kidney or liver disease.\\nPeople with hyperparathyroidism (too much of a hormone that controls the body's calcium level)\\nPeople with sarcoidosis, tuberculosis, histoplasmosis, or other granulomatous disease (disease with granulomas, collections of cells caused by chronic inflammation)\\nPeople with some lymphomas, a type of cancer.\\nPeople who take medicines that affect vitamin D metabolism, such as cholestyramine (a cholesterol drug), anti-seizure drugs, glucocorticoids, antifungal drugs, and HIV/AIDS medicines.\\n\\nTalk with your health care provider if you are at risk for vitamin D deficiency.  There is a blood test which can measure how much vitamin D is in your body.\\nWhat problems does vitamin D deficiency cause?\\nVitamin D deficiency can lead to a loss of bone density, which can contribute to osteoporosis and fractures (broken bones).\\nSevere vitamin D deficiency can also lead to other diseases. In children, it can cause rickets. Rickets is a rare disease that causes the bones to become soft and bend. African American infants and children are at higher risk of getting rickets. In adults, severe vitamin D deficiency leads to osteomalacia. Osteomalacia causes weak bones, bone pain, and muscle weakness.\\nResearchers are studying vitamin D for its possible connections to several medical conditions, including diabetes, high blood pressure, cancer, and autoimmune conditions such as multiple sclerosis. They need to do more research before they can understand the effects of vitamin D on these conditions.\\nHow can I get more vitamin D?\\nThere are a few foods that naturally have some vitamin D:\\nFatty fish such as salmon, tuna, and mackerel\\nBeef liver\\nCheese\\nMushrooms\\nEgg yolks\\n\\nYou can also get vitamin D from fortified foods. You can check the food labels to find out whether a food has vitamin D. Foods that often have added vitamin D include:\\nMilk\\nBreakfast cereals\\nOrange juice\\nOther dairy products, such as yogurt\\nSoy drinks\\n\\nVitamin D is in many multivitamins. There are also vitamin D supplements, both in pills and a liquid for babies.\\nIf you have vitamin D deficiency, the treatment is with supplements. Check with your health care provider about how much you need to take, how often you need to take it, and how long you need to take it.\\nCan too much vitamin D be harmful?\\nGetting too much vitamin D (known as vitamin D toxicity) can be harmful. Signs of toxicity include nausea, vomiting, poor appetite, constipation, weakness, and weight loss. Excess vitamin D can also damage the kidneys. Too much vitamin D also raises the level of calcium in your blood. High levels of blood calcium (hypercalcemia) can cause confusion, disorientation, and problems with heart rhythm.\\nMost cases of vitamin D toxicity happen when someone overuses vitamin D supplements. Excessive sun exposure doesn't cause vitamin D poisoning because the body limits the amount of this vitamin it produces.\\n\",\n",

       " 'Hyperthyroidism': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nWhat is hyperthyroidism?\\nHyperthyroidism, or overactive thyroid, happens when your thyroid gland makes more thyroid hormones than your body needs.\\nYour thyroid is a small, butterfly-shaped gland in the front of your neck. It makes hormones that control the way the body uses energy. These hormones affect nearly every organ in your body and control many of your body's most important functions. For example, they affect your breathing, heart rate, weight, digestion, and moods. If not treated, hyperthyroidism can cause serious problems with your heart, bones, muscles, menstrual cycle, and fertility. But there are treatments that can help.\\nWhat causes hyperthyroidism?\\nHyperthyroidism has several causes. They include:\\nGrave's disease, an autoimmune disorder in which your immune system attacks your thyroid and causes it to make too much hormone. This is the most common cause.\\nThyroid nodules, which are growths on your thyroid. They are usually benign (not cancer). But they may become overactive and make too much thyroid hormone. Thyroid nodules are more common in older adults.\\nThyroiditis, inflammation of the thyroid. It causes stored thyroid hormone to leak out of your thyroid gland.\\nToo much iodine. Iodine is found in some medicines, cough syrups, seaweed and seaweed-based supplements. Taking too much of them can cause your thyroid to make too much thyroid hormone.\\nToo much thyroid medicine. This can happen if people who take thyroid hormone medicine for hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid) take too much of it.\\n\\nWho is at risk for hyperthyroidism?\\nYou are at higher risk for hyperthyroidism if you:\\nAre a woman\\nAre older than age 60\\nHave been pregnant or had a baby within the past 6 months\\nHave had thyroid surgery or a thyroid problem, such as goiter\\nHave a family history of thyroid disease\\nHave pernicious anemia, in which the body cannot make enough healthy red blood cells because it does not have enough vitamin B12\\nHave type 1 diabetes or primary adrenal insufficiency, a hormonal disorder\\nGet too much iodine, from eating large amounts of foods containing iodine or using iodine-containing medicines or supplements\\n\\nWhat are the symptoms of hyperthyroidism?\\nThe symptoms of hyperthyroidism can vary from person to person and may include:\\nNervousness or irritability\\nFatigue\\nMuscle weakness\\nTrouble tolerating heat\\nTrouble sleeping\\nTremor, usually in your hands\\nRapid and irregular heartbeat\\nFrequent bowel movements or diarrhea\\nWeight loss\\nMood swings\\nGoiter, an enlarged thyroid that may cause your neck to look swollen. Sometimes it can cause trouble with breathing or swallowing.\\n\\nAdults over age 60 may have different symptoms than younger adults. For example, they may lose their appetite or withdraw from other people. Sometimes this can be mistaken for depression or dementia.\\nWhat other problems can hyperthyroidism cause?\\nIf hyperthyroidism isn't treated, it can cause some serious health problems, including:\\nAn irregular heartbeat that can lead to blood clots, stroke, heart failure, and other heart problems\\nAn eye disease called Graves' ophthalmopathy. It can cause double vision, light sensitivity, and eye pain. In rare cases, it can lead to vision loss.\\nThinning bones and osteoporosis\\nFertility problems in women\\nComplications in pregnancy, such as premature birth, low birth weight, high blood pressure in pregnancy, and miscarriage\\n\\nHow is hyperthyroidism diagnosed?\\nYour health care provider may use many tools to make a diagnosis:\\nA medical history, including asking about symptoms\\nA physical exam\\nThyroid tests, such as\\n\\t\\t\\nTSH, T3, T4, and thyroid antibody  blood tests\\nImaging tests, such as a thyroid scan, ultrasound, or radioactive iodine uptake test.  A radioactive iodine uptake test measures how much radioactive iodine your thyroid takes up from your blood after you swallow a small amount of it.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat are the treatments for hyperthyroidism?\\nThe treatments for hyperthyroidism include medicines, radioiodine therapy, and thyroid surgery:\\nMedicines for hyperthyroidism include\\n\\t\\t\\nAntithyroid medicines, which cause your thyroid to make less thyroid hormone. You probably need to take the medicines for 1 to 2 years. In some cases, you might need to take the medicines for several years. This is the simplest treatment, but it is often not a permanent cure.\\nBeta blocker medicines, which can reduce symptoms such as tremors, rapid heartbeat, and nervousness. They work quickly and can help you feel better until other treatments take effect.\\n\\n\\nRadioiodine therapy is a common and effective treatment for hyperthyroidism. It involves taking radioactive iodine by mouth as a capsule or liquid. This slowly destroys the cells of the thyroid gland that produce thyroid hormone. It does not affect other body tissues. Almost everyone who has radioactive iodine treatment later develops hypothyroidism. This is because the thyroid hormone-producing cells have been destroyed. But hypothyroidism is easier to treat and causes fewer long-term health problems than hyperthyroidism.\\nSurgery to remove part or most of the thyroid gland is done in rare cases. It might be an option for people with large goiters or pregnant women who cannot take antithyroid medicines. If you have all of your thyroid removed, you will need to take thyroid medicines for the rest of your life. Some people who have part of their thyroid removed also need to take medicines.\\n\\nIf you have hyperthyroidism, it's important not to get too much iodine. Talk to your health care provider about which foods, supplements, and medicines you need to avoid.\\nNIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases\\n\",\n",

They include strong prescription pain relievers, such as oxycodone, hydrocodone, fentanyl, and tramadol. The illegal drug heroin is also an opioid.\\nA health care provider may give you a prescription opioid to reduce pain after you have had a major injury or surgery. You may get them if you have severe pain from health conditions like cancer. Some health care providers prescribe them for chronic pain.\\nPrescription opioids used for pain relief are generally safe when taken for a short time and as prescribed by your health care provider. However, opioid misuse and addiction are still potential risks.\\nWhat are opioid misuse and addiction?\\nOpioid misuse means you are not taking the medicines according to your provider\\'s instructions, you are using them to get high, or you are taking someone else\\'s opioids. Addiction is a chronic brain disease. It causes you to compulsively seek out drugs even though they cause you harm.\\nWhat are the treatments for opioid misuse and addiction?\\nTreatments for opioid misuse and addiction include:\\nMedicines\\nCounseling and behavioral therapies\\nMedication-assisted therapy (MAT), which includes medicines, counseling, and behavioral therapies. This offers a \"whole patient\" approach to treatment, which can increase your chance of a successful recovery.\\nResidential and hospital-based treatment\\n\\nWhich medicines treat opioid misuse and addiction?\\nThe medicines used to treat opioid misuse and addiction are methadone, buprenorphine, and naltrexone.\\nMethadone and buprenorphine can decrease withdrawal symptoms and cravings. They work by acting on the same targets in the brain as other opioids, but they do not make you feel high. Some people worry that if they take methadone or buprenorphine, it means that they are substituting one addiction for another. But it is not; these medicines are a treatment. They restore balance to the parts of the brain affected by addiction. This allows your brain to heal while you work toward recovery.\\nThere is also a combination drug that includes buprenorphine and naloxone. Naloxone is a drug to treat an opioid overdose. If you take it along with buprenorphine, you will be less likely to misuse the buprenorphine.\\nYou may safely take these medicines for months, years, or even a lifetime. If you want to stop taking them, do not do it on your own. You should contact your health care provider first, and work out a plan for stopping.\\nNaltrexone works differently than methadone and buprenorphine. It does not help you with withdrawal symptoms or cravings. Instead, it takes away the high that you would normally get when you take opioids. Because of this, you would take naltrexone to prevent a relapse, not to try to get off opioids. You have to be off opioids for at least 7-10 days before you can take naltrexone. Otherwise you could have bad withdrawal symptoms.\\nHow does counseling treat opioid misuse and addiction?\\nCounseling for opioid misuse and addiction can help you:\\nChange your attitudes and behaviors related to drug use\\nBuild healthy life skills\\nStick with other forms of treatment, such as medicines\\n\\nThere are different types of counseling to treat opioid misuse and addiction, including:\\nIndividual counseling, which may include setting goals, talking about setbacks, and celebrating progress. You may also talk about legal concerns and family problems. Counseling often includes specific behavioral therapies, such as\\n\\nCognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) helps you recognize and stop negative patterns of thinking and behavior. It teaches you coping skills, including how to manage stress and change the thoughts that cause you to want to misuse opioids.\\nMotivational enhancement therapy helps you build up motivation to stick with your treatment plan\\nContingency management focuses on giving you incentives for positive behaviors such as staying off the opioids\\n\\nGroup counseling, which can help you feel that you are not alone with your issues. You get a chance to hear about the difficulties and successes of others who have the same challenges. This can help you to learn new strategies for dealing with the situations you may come across.\\nFamily counseling/ includes partners or spouses and other family members who are close to you. It can help to repair and improve your family relationships.\\n\\nCounselors can also refer you to other resources that you might need, such as:\\nPeer support groups, including 12-step programs like Narcotics Anonymous\\nSpiritual and faith-based groups\\nHIV testing and hepatitis screening\\nCase or care management\\nEmployment or educational supports\\nOrganizations that help you find housing or transportation\\n\\nWhat are residential and hospital-based treatments for opioid misuse and addiction?\\nResidential programs combine housing and treatment services. You are living with your peers, and you can support each other to stay in recovery. Inpatient hospital-based programs combine health care and addiction treatment services for people with medical problems. Hospitals may also offer intensive outpatient treatment. All these types of treatments are very structured, and usually include several different kinds of counseling and behavioral therapies. They also often include medicines.\\n',\n",
       " 'Puberty': '\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nPuberty is the time in life when a boy or girl becomes sexually mature. It is a process that usually happens between ages 10 and 14 for girls and ages 12 and 16 for boys.  It causes physical changes, and affects boys and girls differently.\\nIn girls:\\n\\nThe first sign of puberty is usually breast development.\\nThen hair grows in the pubic area and armpits.\\nMenstruation (or a period) usually happens last.\\n\\nIn boys:\\n\\nPuberty usually begins with the testicles and penis getting bigger.\\nThen hair grows in the pubic area and armpits.\\nMuscles grow, the voice deepens, and facial hair develops as puberty continues.\\n\\nBoth boys and girls may get acne.  They also usually have a growth spurt (a rapid increase in height) that lasts for about 2 or 3 years.  This brings them closer to their adult height, which they reach after puberty.  \\nNIH: National Institute of Child Health and Human Development\\n',\n",
       " 'Osteoarthritis': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nWhat is osteoarthritis?\\nOsteoarthritis, sometimes called OA, is a type of arthritis that only affects the joints, usually in the hands, knees, hips, neck, and lower back. It's the most common type of arthritis.\\nIn a healthy joint, the ends of the bones are covered with a smooth, slippery tissue called cartilage. The cartilage pads the bones and helps them glide easily when you move the joint. With osteoarthritis, the cartilage breaks down and becomes rough. Sometimes, all the cartilage wears away and the bones rub together. Bumps of extra bone called bone spurs may grow in the joint area.\\nThere is no cure for osteoarthritis. It usually gets worse slowly. But there's a lot you can do to manage the symptoms.\\nWhat are the symptoms of osteoarthritis?\\nOsteoarthritis affects people in different ways, and not everyone has pain. The most common symptoms are:\\n\\nPain when you move, which often gets better with rest\\nStiffness, especially for the first 30 minutes after you get up from resting\\nSwollen joints, especially after using the joint a lot\\nLess movement in the joint than normal\\nA joint that feels loose or unstable\\n\\nWhat causes osteoarthritis?\\nResearchers aren't sure what causes osteoarthritis. They think that it could be caused by a combination of factors in the body and the environment. Your chance of developing osteoarthritis increases with age. They also know that some people are more likely to develop it than others.\\nWho is more likely to develop osteoarthritis?\\nThings that make you more likely to develop osteoarthritis include:\\n\\nAging. Osteoarthritis can happen at any age, but the chance of getting it increases in middle-aged adults and older. After age 50, it is more common in women than in men.\\nBeing overweight. Extra weight puts more stress on your joints.\\nHaving a past injury or surgery on a joint. This is often the cause of osteoarthritis in younger adults.\\nDoing a lot of activities that overuse the joint. This includes sports with a lot of jumping, twisting, running, or throwing.\\nHaving a joint that doesn't line up correctly.\\nA family history of osteoarthritis. Some people inherit genetic changes that increase their chance of developing osteoarthritis.\\n\\nHow is osteoarthritis diagnosed?\\nThere is no specific test for osteoarthritis. To find out if you have osteoarthritis, your provider:\\n\\nWill ask about your symptoms and medical history\\nWill do a physical exam\\nMay use x-rays or other imaging tests to look at your joints\\nMay order lab tests to make sure that a different problem isn't causing your symptoms\\n\\nWhat are the treatments for osteoarthritis?\\nThe goal of treating osteoarthritis is to ease your pain, help you move better, and stop it from getting worse.\\nTreatment usually begins with:\\n\\nExercises to improve strength, flexibility and balance\\nWeight loss, if needed, to improve pain, especially in your hips or knees\\nBraces or shoe inserts (orthotics) that a health care provider fits for you\\n\\nYou can buy some pain relievers and arthritis creams without a prescription. They can be helpful, but it's best to talk to your provider about using them. If they don't help enough, your provider may prescribe injections (shots) into the joint or prescription pain relievers.\\nComplementary therapies may help some people. Massage can increase blood flow and bring warmth to the area. Some research shows that acupuncture may help relieve osteoarthritis pain. Simple things like heat and ice can help, too.\\nIf none of these treatments help enough, surgery may be an option. You and your provider can decide if it's right for you.\\nNIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases\\n\",\n",

You sweat mainly under your arms and on your feet and palms. When sweat mixes with bacteria on your skin, it can cause a smell. Bathing regularly and using antiperspirants or deodorants can help control the odor. \\nSweating a lot is normal when it is hot or when you exercise, are anxious, or have a fever. It also happens during menopause. If you often sweat too much, it's called hyperhidrosis. Causes include thyroid or nervous system disorders, low blood sugar, or another health problem. \\nSweating too little, anhidrosis, can be life-threatening because your body can overheat. Causes of anhidrosis include dehydration, burns, and some skin and nerve disorders.  \\n\",\n",

Pesticides are not just insect killers. They also include chemicals to control weeds, rodents, mildew, germs, and more. Many household products contain pesticides.\\nPesticides can protect your health by killing germs, animals, or plants that could hurt you.  However, they can also be harmful to people or pets. You might want to try non-chemical methods first. If you do need a pesticide, use it correctly. Be especially careful around children and pets.

Your blood pressure may rise. Your body may retain excess fluid and not make enough red blood cells. This is called kidney failure.\\nIf your kidneys fail, you need treatment to replace the work they normally do. The treatment options are dialysis or a kidney transplant. Each treatment has benefits and drawbacks. No matter which treatment you choose, you'll need to make some changes in your life, including how you eat and plan your activities.

       " 'Immune System and Disorders': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nWhat is the immune system?\\nYour immune system is a complex network of cells, tissues, and organs. Together they help the body fight infections and other diseases.\\nWhen germs such as bacteria or viruses invade your body, they attack and multiply. This is called an infection. The infection causes the disease that makes you sick. Your immune system protects you from the disease by fighting off the germs.\\nWhat are the parts of the immune system?\\nThe immune system has many different parts, including:\\nYour skin, which can help prevent germs from getting into the body\\nMucous membranes, which are the moist, inner linings of some organs and body cavities. They make mucus and other substances which can trap and fight germs.\\nWhite blood cells, which fight germs\\nOrgans and tissues of the lymph system, such as the thymus, spleen, tonsils, lymph nodes, lymph vessels, and bone marrow.  They produce, store, and carry white blood cells.\\n\\nHow does the immune system work?\\nYour immune system defends your body against substances it sees as harmful or foreign. These substances are called antigens. They may be germs such as bacteria and viruses. They might be chemicals or toxins. They could also be cells that are damaged from things like cancer or sunburn.\\nWhen your immune system recognizes an antigen, it attacks it. This is called an immune response. Part of this response is to make antibodies. Antibodies are proteins that work to attack, weaken, and destroy antigens. Your body also makes other cells to fight the antigen.\\nAfterwards, your immune system remembers the antigen. If it sees the antigen again, it can recognize it. It will quickly send out the right antibodies, so in most cases, you don't get sick. This protection against a certain disease is called immunity.\\nWhat are the types of immunity?\\nThere are three different types of immunity:\\nInnate immunity is the protection that you are born with. It is your body's first line of defense. It includes barriers such as the skin and mucous membranes. They keep harmful substances from entering the body. It also includes some cells and chemicals which can attack foreign substances.\\nActive immunity, also called adaptive immunity, develops when you are infected with or vaccinated against a foreign substance. Active immunity is usually long-lasting. For many diseases, it can last your entire life.\\nPassive immunity happens when you receive antibodies to a disease instead of making them through your own immune system. For example, newborn babies have antibodies from their mothers. People can also get passive immunity through blood products that contain antibodies. This kind of immunity gives you protection right away. But it only lasts a few weeks or months.\\n\\nWhat can go wrong with the immune system?\\nSometimes a person may have an immune response even though there is no real threat. This can lead to problems such as allergies, asthma, and autoimmune diseases. If you have an autoimmune disease, your immune system attacks healthy cells in your body by mistake.\\nOther immune system problems happen when your immune system does not work correctly. These problems include immunodeficiency diseases. If you have an immunodeficiency disease, you get sick more often. Your infections may last longer and can be more serious and harder to treat. They are often genetic disorders.\\nThere are other diseases that can affect your immune system. For example, HIV is a virus that harms your immune system by destroying your white blood cells. If HIV is not treated, it can lead to AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome). People with AIDS have badly damaged immune systems. They get an increasing number of severe illnesses.\\n\",\n",
       " 'High Blood Pressure in Pregnancy': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nWhat is high blood pressure in pregnancy?\\nBlood pressure is the force of your blood pushing against the walls of your arteries as your heart pumps blood. High blood pressure, or hypertension, is when this force against your artery walls is too high.  There are different types of high blood pressure in pregnancy:\\nGestational hypertension is high blood pressure that you develop while you are pregnant. It starts after you are 20 weeks pregnant. You usually don't have any other symptoms. In many cases, it does not harm you or your baby, and it goes away within 12 weeks after childbirth. But it does raise your risk of high blood pressure in the future. It sometimes can be severe, which may lead to low birth weight or preterm birth. Some women with gestational hypertension do go on to develop preeclampsia.\\nChronic hypertension is high blood pressure that started before the 20th week of pregnancy or before you became pregnant. Some women may have had it long before becoming pregnant but didn't know it until they got their blood pressure checked at their prenatal visit. Sometimes chronic hypertension can also lead to preeclampsia.\\nPreeclampsia is a sudden increase in blood pressure after the 20th week of pregnancy. It usually happens in the last trimester. In rare cases, symptoms may not start until after delivery. This is called postpartum preeclampsia. Preeclampsia also includes signs of damage to some of your organs, such as your liver or kidney. The signs may include protein in the urine and very high blood pressure. Preeclampsia can be serious or even life-threatening for both you and your baby.\\n\\nWhat causes preeclampsia?\\nThe cause of preeclampsia is unknown.\\nWho is at risk for preeclampsia?\\nYou are at higher risk of preeclampsia if you:\\nHad chronic high blood pressure or chronic kidney disease before pregnancy\\nHad high blood pressure or preeclampsia in a previous pregnancy\\nHave obesity\\nAre over age 40\\nAre pregnant with more than one baby\\nAre African American\\nHave a family history of preeclampsia\\nHave certain health conditions, such as diabetes, lupus, or thrombophilia (a disorder which raises your risk of blood clots)\\nUsed in vitro fertilization, egg donation, or donor insemination\\n\\nWhat problems can preeclampsia cause?\\nPreeclampsia can cause:\\nPlacental abruption, where the placenta separates from the uterus\\nPoor fetal growth, caused by a lack of nutrients and oxygen\\nPreterm birth\\nA low birth weight baby\\nStillbirth\\nDamage to your kidneys, liver, brain, and other organ and blood systems\\nA higher risk of heart disease for you\\nEclampsia, which happens when preeclampsia is severe enough to affect brain function, causing seizures or coma\\nHELLP syndrome, which happens when a woman with preeclampsia or eclampsia has damage to the liver and blood cells. It is rare, but very serious.\\n\\nWhat are the symptoms of preeclampsia?\\nPossible symptoms of preeclampsia include:\\nHigh blood pressure\\nToo much protein in your urine (called proteinuria)\\nSwelling in your face and hands. Your feet may also swell, but many women have swollen feet during pregnancy. So swollen feet by themselves may not be a sign of a problem.\\nHeadache that does not go away\\nVision problems, including blurred vision or seeing spots\\nPain in your upper right abdomen\\nTrouble breathing\\n\\nEclampsia can also cause seizures, nausea and/or vomiting, and low urine output. If you go on to develop HELLP syndrome, you may also have bleeding or bruising easily, extreme fatigue, and liver failure.\\nHow is preeclampsia diagnosed?\\nYour health care provider will check your blood pressure and urine at each prenatal visit. If your blood pressure reading is high (140/90 or higher), especially after the 20th week of pregnancy, your provider will likely want to run some tests. They may include blood tests other lab tests to look for extra protein in the urine as well as other symptoms.\\nWhat are the treatments for preeclampsia?\\nDelivering the baby can often cure preeclampsia. When making a decision about treatment, your provider take into account several factors. They include how severe it is, how many weeks pregnant you are, and what the potential risks to you and your baby are:\\nIf you are more than 37 weeks pregnant, your provider will likely want to deliver the baby.\\nIf you are less than 37 weeks pregnant, your health care provider will closely monitor you and your baby. This includes blood and urine tests for you. Monitoring for the baby often involves ultrasound, heart rate monitoring, and checking on the baby's growth. You may need to take medicines, to control your blood pressure and to prevent seizures. Some women also get steroid injections, to help the baby's lungs mature faster. If the preeclampsia is severe, you provider may want you to deliver the baby early.\\n\\nThe symptoms usually go away within 6 weeks of delivery. In rare cases, symptoms may not go away, or they may not start until after delivery (postpartum preeclampsia). This can be very serious, and it needs to be treated right away.\\n\",\n",

The liver makes cholesterol, and it is also in some foods, such as meat and dairy products. The body needs some cholesterol to work properly. But if your child or teen has high cholesterol (too much cholesterol in the blood), he or she has a higher risk of coronary artery disease and other heart diseases.\\nWhat causes high cholesterol in children and teens?\\nThree main factors contribute to high cholesterol in children and teens:\\nAn unhealthy diet, especially one that is high in fats\\nA family history of high cholesterol, especially when one or both parents have high cholesterol\\nObesity\\n\\nSome diseases, such as diabetes, kidney disease, and certain thyroid diseases, can also cause high cholesterol in children and teens.\\nWhat are the symptoms of high cholesterol in children and teens?\\nThere are usually no signs or symptoms that your child or teen has high cholesterol.\\nHow do I know if my child or teen has high cholesterol?\\nThere is a blood test to measure cholesterol levels. The test gives information about:\\nTotal cholesterol - a measure of the total amount of cholesterol in your blood. It includes both low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol.\\nLDL (bad) cholesterol - the main source of cholesterol buildup and blockage in the arteries\\nHDL (good) cholesterol - HDL helps remove cholesterol from your arteries\\nNon-HDL - this number is your total cholesterol minus your HDL. Your non-HDL includes LDL and other types of cholesterol such as VLDL (very-low-density lipoprotein).\\nTriglycerides - another form of fat in your blood that can raise your risk for heart disease\\n\\nFor anyone aged 19 or younger, the healthy levels of cholesterol are\\n\\n\\n\\nType of Cholesterol\\nHealthy Level\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTotal Cholesterol\\nLess than 170mg/dL\\n\\n\\nNon-HDL\\nLess than 120mg/dL\\n\\n\\nLDL\\nLess than 100mg/dL\\n\\n\\nHDL\\nMore than 45mg/dL\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen and how often your child or teen should get this test depends on his or her age, risk factors, and family history. The general recommendations are:\\nThe first test should be between ages 9 to 11\\nChildren should have the test again every 5 years\\nSome children may have this test starting at age 2 if there is a family history of high blood cholesterol, heart attack, or stroke\\n\\nWhat are the treatments for high cholesterol in children and teens?\\nLifestyle changes are the main treatment for high cholesterol in children and teens. These changes include:\\nBeing more active. This includes getting regular exercise and spending less time sitting (in front of a television, at a computer, on a phone or tablet, etc.)\\nHealthy eating. A diet to lower cholesterol includes limiting foods that are high in saturated fat, sugar, and trans fat. It is also important to eat plenty of fresh fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.\\nLosing weight, if your child or teen is overweight or has obesity\\n\\nIf everyone in the family makes these changes, it will be easier for your child or teen to stick to them. It is also an opportunity to improve your health, and the health of the rest of your family.\\nSometimes these lifestyle changes are not enough to lower your child or teen's cholesterol. Your health care provider may consider giving your child or teen cholesterol medicines if he or she:\\nIs at least 10 years old\\nHas an LDL (bad) cholesterol level that is higher than 190 mg/dL, even after six months of diet and exercise changes\\nHas an LDL (bad) cholesterol level that is higher than 160 mg/dL AND is at high risk for heart disease\\nHas an inherited type of high cholesterol\\n\\n\",\n",
       " 'Primary Ovarian Insufficiency': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nWhat is primary ovarian insufficiency (POI)?\\nPrimary ovarian insufficiency (POI), also known as premature ovarian failure, happens when a woman's ovaries stop working normally before she is 40.\\nMany women naturally experience reduced fertility when they are about 40 years old. They may start getting irregular menstrual periods as they transition to menopause. For women with POI, irregular periods and reduced fertility start before the age of 40. Sometimes it can start as early as the teenage years.\\nPOI is different from premature menopause. With premature menopause, your periods stop before age 40. You can no longer get pregnant. The cause can be natural or it can be a disease, surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation. With POI, some women still have occasional periods. They may even get pregnant.  In most cases of POI, the cause is unknown.\\nWhat causes primary ovarian insufficiency (POI)?\\nIn about 90% of cases, the exact cause of POI is unknown.\\nResearch shows that POI is related to problems with the follicles. Follicles are small sacs in your ovaries. Your eggs grow and mature inside them. One type of follicle problem is that you run out of working follicles earlier than normal. Another is that the follicles are not working properly. In most cases, the cause of the follicle problem is unknown. But sometimes the cause may be:\\nGenetic disorders such as Fragile X syndrome and Turner syndrome\\nA low number of follicles\\nAutoimmune diseases, including thyroiditis and Addison disease\\nChemotherapy or radiation therapy\\nMetabolic disorders\\nToxins, such as cigarette smoke, chemicals, and pesticides\\n\\nWho is at risk for primary ovarian insufficiency (POI)?\\nCertain factors can raise a woman's risk of POI:\\nFamily history. Women who have a mother or sister with POI are more likely to have it.\\nGenes. Some changes to genes and genetic conditions put women at higher risk for POI. For example, women Fragile X syndrome or Turner syndrome are at higher risk.\\nCertain diseases, such as autoimmune diseases and viral infections\\nCancer treatments, such as chemotherapy and radiation therapy\\nAge. Younger women can get POI, but it becomes more common between the ages of 35-40.\\n\\nWhat are the symptoms of primary ovarian insufficiency (POI)?\\nThe first sign of POI is usually irregular or missed periods. Later symptoms may be similar to those of natural menopause:\\nHot flashes\\nNight sweats\\nIrritability\\nPoor concentration\\nDecreased sex drive\\nPain during sex\\nVaginal dryness\\n\\nFor many women with POI, trouble getting pregnant or infertility is the reason they go to their health care provider.\\nWhat other problems can primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) cause?\\nSince POI causes you to have lower levels of certain hormones, you are at greater risk for other health conditions, including:\\nAnxiety and depression. Hormonal changes caused by POI can contribute to anxiety or lead to depression.\\nDry eye syndrome and eye surface disease. Some women with POI have one of these eye conditions. Both can cause discomfort and may lead to blurred vision. If not treated, these conditions can cause permanent eye damage.\\nHeart disease. Lower levels of estrogen can affect the muscles lining the arteries and can increase the buildup of cholesterol in the arteries. These factors increase your risk of atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries).\\nInfertility.\\nLow thyroid function. This problem also is called hypothyroidism. The thyroid is a gland that makes hormones that control your body's metabolism and energy level. Low levels thyroid hormones can affect your metabolism and can cause very low energy, mental sluggishness, and other symptoms.\\nOsteoporosis. The hormone estrogen helps keep bones strong. Without enough estrogen, women with POI often develop osteoporosis. It is a bone disease that causes weak, brittle bones that are more likely to break.\\n\\nHow is primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) diagnosed?\\nTo diagnose POI, your health care provider may do:\\nA medical history, including asking whether you have relatives with POI\\nA pregnancy test, to make sure that you are not pregnant\\nA physical exam, to look for signs of other disorders which could be causing your symptoms\\nBlood tests, to check for certain hormone levels. You may also have a blood test to do a chromosome analysis. A chromosome is the part of a cell that contains genetic information.\\nA pelvic ultrasound, to see whether or not the ovaries are enlarged or have multiple follicles\\n\\nHow is primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) treated?\\nCurrently, there is no proven treatment to restore normal function to a woman's ovaries.  But there are treatments for some of the symptoms of POI. There are also ways to lower your health risks and treat the conditions that POI can cause:\\nHormone replacement therapy (HRT). HRT is the most common treatment. It gives your body the estrogen and other hormones that your ovaries are not making. HRT improves sexual health and decreases the risks for heart disease and osteoporosis. You usually take it until about age 50; that's about the age when menopause usually begins.\\nCalcium and vitamin D supplements. Because women with POI are at higher risk for osteoporosis, you should take calcium and vitamin D every day.\\nIn vitro fertilization (IVF). If you have POI and you wish to become pregnant, you may consider trying IVF.\\nRegular physical activity and a healthy body weight. Getting regular exercise and controlling your weight can lower your risk for osteoporosis and heart disease.\\nTreatments for associated conditions. If you have a condition that is related to POI, it is important to treat that as well. Treatments may involve medicines and hormones.\\n\\nNIH: National Institute of Child Health and Human Development\\n\",\n",
       " 'Diabetic Eye Problems': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nWhat is diabetes?\\nDiabetes is a disease in which your blood glucose, or blood sugar, levels are too high. Glucose comes from foods you eat. The cells of your body need glucose for energy. A hormone called insulin helps the glucose get into your cells.\\nWith type 1 diabetes, your body doesn't make insulin. With type 2 diabetes, your body doesn't make or use insulin well. Without enough insulin, glucose builds up in your blood and causes high blood sugar levels.\\nWhat eye problems can diabetes cause?\\nOver time, high blood sugar may damage the blood vessels and lenses in your eyes. This can lead to serious diabetic eye problems which can harm your vision and sometimes cause blindness. Some common diabetes eye problems include:\\n\\nDiabetic retinopathy, which is the leading cause of blindness in American adults. It affects blood vessels in the retina (the light-sensitive layer of tissue in the back of your eye). The blood vessels may swell and leak fluid into your eye. If it's not treated, it can cause serious problems such as vision loss and retinal detachment, where the retina is pulled away from its normal position at the back of your eye.\\nDiabetic macular edema (DME), which happens when blood vessels in the retina leak fluid into the macula (a part of the retina needed for sharp, central vision). This usually develops in people who already have other signs of diabetic retinopathy.\\nGlaucoma, a group of eye diseases that can damage the optic nerve (the bundle of nerves that connects the eye to the brain). Glaucoma from diabetes happens when the blood vessels in the front of your eye are damaged, and new blood vessels grow near the iris (the colored part of your eye). The blood vessels block the space where fluid drains from your eye. This causes fluid to build up and pressure to increase inside your eye.\\nCataract, which happen when the clear lens in the front of your eye becomes cloudy. Cataracts are common as people age. But people with diabetes are more likely to develop cataracts younger and faster than people without diabetes. Researchers think that high glucose levels cause deposits to build up in the lenses of your eyes.\\n\\nWho is more likely to develop diabetic eye problems?\\nAnyone with diabetes can develop diabetic eye disease. But your risk of developing it is higher if you:\\n\\nHave had diabetes for a long time\\nDon't have good control over your high blood sugar or high blood pressure\\nAre pregnant\\nHave high blood cholesterol\\nSmoke tobacco\\n\\nWhat are the symptoms of diabetic eye problems?\\nIn the early stages, diabetic eye problems usually don't have any symptoms. That's why regular dilated eye exams are so important, even if you think your eyes are healthy.\\nYou should also watch for sudden changes in your vision that could mean an emergency. Call your doctor right away if you notice any of these symptoms:\\n\\nMany new spots or dark wavy strings floating in your vision (floaters)\\nFlashes of light\\nA dark shadow over part of your vision, like a curtain\\nVision loss\\nEye pain or redness\\n\\nTalk with your doctor if you have these symptoms, even if they come and go:\\n\\nSpots or dark wavy strings floating in your vision\\nBlurry or wavy vision\\nVision that changes a lot\\nTrouble seeing colors\\n\\nHow are diabetic eye problems diagnosed?\\nEye doctors do dilated eye exams to diagnose eye problems. A dilated eye exam uses eye drops to open your pupils wide so your doctor can look for signs of eye problems and treat them before they harm your vision. Your doctor will also test your vision and measure the pressure in your eyes.\\nWhat are the treatments for diabetic eye problems?\\nTreatment for diabetic eye problems depends on the problem and how serious it is. Some of the treatments include:\\n\\nLasers to stop blood vessels from leaking\\nInjections (shots) in the eye to stop new, leaky blood vessels from growing\\nSurgery to remove blood and scar tissue or replace a cloudy lens\\nEye drops to lower fluid pressure in the eye\\n\\nBut these treatments aren't cures. Eye problems can come back. That's why your best defense against serious vision loss is to take control of your diabetes and get regular eye exams. It's also important to keep your blood pressure and cholesterol in a healthy range.\\nNIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases\\n\",\n",

You may just need to give the medicine a little more time to do its job.\\nSometimes an antidepressant helps at first, but symptoms return while you\\'re still taking it. But there\\'s usually another one you can try. To get more relief from depression, your provider may suggest combining two antidepressants, using another kind of medicine with an antidepressant, or adding talk therapy or other approaches to improve your mental health.\\nHow long will I need to take an antidepressant?\\nWhen an antidepressant starts to work, you and your provider can decide how long you need to stay on it. The typical length of treatment is 6 to 12 months, but some people may stay on antidepressants for much longer.\\nWhat are the side effects of antidepressants?\\nNot everyone has side effects from antidepressants. But if you do have them, they\\'re usually mild and may get better over time as your body gets used to the new medicine.\\nThe most common side effects from antidepressants include:\\n\\nNausea and vomiting\\nWeight gain\\nDiarrhea\\nSleepiness\\nSexual problems, such as a lack of desire or ability to have sex\\n\\nWhen thinking about side effects, it\\'s important to remember that there are also risks from not treating depression. Your provider can help you think through the pros and cons of all your options.\\nIf you have any side effects from antidepressants, your provider may suggest ways to manage them while you wait to see if the antidepressant will work. If the side effects bother you too much, you may need to change antidepressants. But you should never change your dose or stop taking an antidepressant on your own.\\nIf you have serious problems or notice any changes that worry you, such as new or worsening symptoms, unusual changes in your mood, or you start acting differently, call your provider right away.\\nIn some cases, children, teenagers, and young adults under 25 may be more likely to think about hurting or killing themselves when starting antidepressants or when the dose is changed. Get medical help right away if this happens.\\nWhat can I do to take antidepressants safely?\\nAntidepressants are generally safe when you use them correctly:\\n\\nTell your provider about everything you take. That includes medicines, herbs, supplements, and over-the-counter medicines you take, such as pain relievers and decongestants. Be honest about recreational drugs and alcohol, too.\\nTry to get all your medicines from the same pharmacy. That way the pharmacist can warn you and your provider if you take medicines that may cause problems when used together.\\nFollow all instructions about how to take your medicine.\\nTalk with your provider if side effects bother you.\\nNever stop taking antidepressants without your provider\\'s help. Stopping too fast may make depression come back. You could even make your condition worse. To stop antidepressants safely, you need to give your body time to get used to being without the medicine. Your provider can tell you the safest way to go off an antidepressant.\\n\\nNIH: National Institute of Mental Health\\n',\n",
       " 'Thyroid Diseases': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nYour thyroid is a butterfly-shaped gland in your neck, just above your collarbone.  It is one of your endocrine glands, which make hormones.  Thyroid hormones control the rate of many activities in your body. These include how fast you burn calories and how fast your heart beats. All of these activities are your body's metabolism.\\nThyroid problems include:\\nGoiter - enlargement of the thyroid gland\\nHyperthyroidism - when your thyroid gland makes more thyroid hormones than your body needs\\nHypothyroidism - when your thyroid gland does not make enough thyroid hormones\\nThyroid cancer\\nThyroid nodules - lumps in the thyroid gland\\nThyroiditis - swelling of the thyroid\\n\\nTo diagnose thyroid diseases, doctors use a medical history, physical exam, and thyroid tests.

       " 'Tremor': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nWhat is a tremor?\\nA tremor is a rhythmic shaking movement in one or more parts of your body. It is involuntary, meaning that you cannot control it. This shaking happens because of muscle contractions.\\nA tremor is most often in your hands, but it could also affect your arms, head, vocal cords, trunk, and legs. It may come and go, or it may be constant. Tremor can happen on its own or be caused by another disorder.\\nWhat are the types of tremor?\\nThere are several types of tremor, including:\\nEssential tremor, sometimes called benign essential tremor. This is the most common type. It usually affects your hands, but it can also affect your head, voice, tongue, legs, and trunk.\\nParkinsonian tremor, which is a common symptom in people who have Parkinson's disease. It is usually affects one or both hands when they are at rest, but it can affect the chin, lips, face, and legs.\\nDystonic tremor, which happens in people who have dystonia. Dystonia is a movement disorder in which you have involuntary muscle contractions. The contractions cause you to have twisting and repetitive movements. It can affect any muscle in the body.\\n\\nWhat causes tremor?\\nGenerally, tremor is caused by a problem in the deep parts of the brain that control movements. For most types, the cause is unknown. Some types are inherited and run in families. There can also be other causes, such as:\\nNeurologic disorders, including multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, stroke, and traumatic brain injury\\nCertain medicines, such as asthma medicines, amphetamines, caffeine, corticosteroids, and medicines used for certain psychiatric and neurological disorders\\nAlcohol use disorder or alcohol withdrawal\\nMercury poisoning\\nHyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid)\\nLiver or kidney failure\\nAnxiety or panic\\n\\nWho is at risk for tremor?\\nAnyone can get tremor, but it is most common in middle-aged and older adults. For certain types, having a family history raises your risk of getting it.\\nWhat are the symptoms of tremor?\\nSymptoms of tremor may include:\\nRhythmic shaking in the hands, arms, head, legs, or torso\\nShaky voice\\nDifficulty writing or drawing\\nProblems holding and controlling utensils, such as a spoon\\n\\nHow is tremor diagnosed?\\nYour health care provider may use many tools to make a diagnosis:\\nA medical history, which includes asking about your symptoms \\nA physical exam, which includes checking\\n\\t\\t\\nWhether the tremor happens when the muscles are at rest or in action\\nThe location of the tremor\\nHow often you have the tremor and how strong it is\\n\\n\\nA neurological exam, including checking for\\n\\t\\t\\nProblems with balance\\nProblems with speech\\nIncreased muscle stiffness\\n\\n\\nBlood or urine tests to look for the cause\\nImaging tests to help figure out if the cause is damage in your brain\\nTests which check your abilities to do daily tasks such as handwriting and holding a fork or cup\\nAn electromyogram, a test which measures involuntary muscle activity and how your muscles respond to nerve stimulation\\n\\nWhat are the treatments for tremor?\\nThere is no cure for most forms of tremor, but there are treatments to help manage symptoms. In some cases, the symptoms may be so mild that you do not need treatment.\\nFinding the right treatment depends on getting the right diagnosis of the cause. Tremor caused by another medical condition may get better or go away when you treat that condition. If your tremor is caused by a certain medicine, stopping that medicine usually makes the tremor go away.\\nTreatments for tremor where the cause is not found include:\\nMedicines. There are different medicines for the specific types of tremor. Another option is Botox injections, which can treat several different types.\\nSurgery may be used for severe cases that do not get better with medicines. The most common type is deep brain stimulation (DBS).\\nPhysical, speech-language, and occupational therapy, which may help to control tremor and deal with the daily challenges caused by the tremor\\n\\nIf you find that caffeine and other stimulants trigger your tremors, it may be helpful to cut them from your diet.\\nNIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke\\n\",\n",
       " 'Endocarditis': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nWhat is endocarditis?\\nEndocarditis is sometimes called infective endocarditis. It's a rare, but life-threatening inflammation of the lining inside your heart's chambers and valves (the endocardium).\\nEndocarditis is usually caused by germs that get into your bloodstream and travel to your heart. Once they get inside your heart, the germs can attach to the lining or get trapped in the valves. They start to grow, causing an infection. If not treated quickly, the infection can cause damage to the heart and lead to serious health problems.\\nWhat causes endocarditis?\\nBacterial infections cause most endocarditis. Normally, many bacteria live in your mouth, on your skin, or in other parts of the body. Sometimes the bacteria can get into your bloodstream from injuries such cuts or scrapes. Dental work and certain surgeries can also allow small amounts of bacteria to enter your bloodstream.\\nIn some cases, fungal infections cause endocarditis. The fungi, such as yeast, can live in parts of your body. Fungal infections generally happen in people who have weakened immune systems that can't stop the fungus from growing. This includes people who have HIV/AIDS.\\nWho is more likely to develop endocarditis?\\nIn general, endocarditis is rare. If you're healthy, your immune system usually destroys the germs in your bloodstream before they can cause harm.\\nBut your chance of developing endocarditis may be higher than most people if you:\\n\\nHave certain heart conditions. Damaged or abnormal heart tissue and devices in your heart can trap germs more easily than healthy heart tissue. That means your risk of endocarditis is higher if you have:\\n\\t\\nHeart valve disease.\\nCertain congenital heart defects.\\nA pacemaker or an implantable defibrillator.\\nA heart valve replacement.\\n\\n\\nAre older. Age-related changes to the heart valves, such as mitral valve prolapse or calcium deposits in the aortic valve, create places for germs to attach to the heart.\\nInject illegal drugs. Unclean needles may carry bacteria into the bloodstream.\\nHave a condition that weakens your immune system.\\nDon't take care of your teeth and gums. Poor dental health makes it easier for germs to get into your bloodstream through your gums and mouth.\\nHave a long-term central venous line, a tube that stays in a large vein for weeks or months for medical treatment.\\nHave already had endocarditis. Endocarditis can damage heart tissue, which increases your risk of getting it again.\\n\\nWhat are the symptoms of endocarditis?\\nEndocarditis symptoms may be severe or very mild. They may start suddenly or slowly. And they can vary from person to person. The possible symptoms of endocarditis include:\\n\\nFever and chills\\nNew or worsening heart murmur (an unusual sound heard between heartbeats)\\nChest pain\\nCough\\nMuscle, joint, and back pain\\nNight sweats (heavy sweating during sleep)\\nShortness of breath (feeling like you can't get enough air)\\nSkin changes, including:\\n\\t\\nBroken blood vessels\\nPainful red or purple bumps\\nPainless flat red spots on the palms of your hands or soles of your feet\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat other problems can endocarditis cause?\\nWhen the germs are in your heart, they can clump together with blood cells. These clumps can break off and travel through your bloodstream. They may block blood flow, spread infection, or damage your organs, including your brain, lungs, kidneys, and spleen.\\nEndocarditis may sometimes lead to sepsis, a medical emergency that happens when your body has an extreme response to the infection.\\nEndocarditis can also cause serious heart problems including:\\n\\nHeart valve damage\\nHeart failure\\nArrhythmia (a problem with the rate or rhythm of your heartbeat)\\n\\nHow is endocarditis diagnosed?\\nTo find out if you have endocarditis, your doctor will:\\n\\nAsk about your medical history, including your symptoms, recent illnesses, and other health conditions that affect your chance of developing endocarditis.\\nDo a physical exam.\\nLikely order tests, such as:\\n\\t\\nBlood tests to check for signs of infection,  bacteria, or fungi in your blood.\\nChest x-rays.\\nHeart tests.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat are the treatments for endocarditis?\\nIf you have endocarditis, it's important to get treatment quickly. Treatments may include:\\n\\nMedicines\\n\\nAntibiotics to treat bacterial infections. Antibiotics are usually started through an intravenous (IV) line in the hospital.\\nAntifungal medicine to treat fungal infections. Your doctor may suggest taking antifungal medicine for the rest of your life to prevent the infection from coming back.\\n\\n\\nHeart surgery may be needed to repair or replace damaged valves and heart tissue. Surgery may also be done to remove infected tissue.\\nDental care, especially cleanings, can help reduce the amount of bacteria that grows in your mouth.\\n\\nTreatment may last weeks, and you may need tests to make sure it's working. Your doctor will also check you for problems that could develop from endocarditis, such as heart failure or an irregular heartbeat.\\nCan endocarditis be prevented?\\nIf you have a higher chance of developing endocarditis than most people, you can reduce your risk if you:\\n\\nTake good care of your teeth and gums every day\\nHave dental exams and cleaning at your dentist's office every 6 months\\nMake heart-healthy habits part of your daily life to help prevent heart disease\\nCall your health care provider right away if you have symptoms that could be endocarditis\\n\\nPeople with the highest risk for bacterial endocarditis need antibiotics before dental visits or certain medical or surgical procedures. Ask your provider if you're part of the highest risk group. If so, let all your providers know about your risk.\\nNIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute\\n\",\n",

       " 'Diabetic Foot': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nWhat is diabetes?\\nDiabetes is a disease in which your blood glucose, or blood sugar, levels are too high. Glucose comes from foods you eat. The cells of your body need glucose for energy. A hormone called insulin helps the glucose get into your cells.\\nWith type 1 diabetes, your body doesn't make insulin. With type 2 diabetes, your body doesn't make or use insulin well. Without enough insulin, glucose can't get into your cells as quickly as usual. The glucose builds up in your blood and causes high blood sugar levels.\\nHow does diabetes cause foot problems?\\nFoot problems are common in people with diabetes. They can happen over time when high blood sugar damages the nerves and blood vessels in the feet. The nerve damage, called diabetic neuropathy, can cause numbness, tingling, pain, or a loss of feeling in your feet.\\nIf you can't feel pain, you may not know when you have a cut, blister, or ulcer (open sore) on your foot. A wound like that could get infected. The infection may not heal well because the damaged blood vessels can cause poor blood flow in your feet.\\nHaving an infection and poor blood flow can lead to gangrene. That means the muscle, skin, and other tissues start to die. If you have gangrene or a foot ulcer that does not get better with treatment, you may need an amputation. This is a surgery to cut off your damaged toe, foot, or part of your leg. It may prevent a bad infection from spreading and could save your life.\\nBut there's a lot you can do to prevent a foot wound from becoming a major health problem.\\nHow can I protect my feet if I have diabetes?\\nThe best way to protect your feet is by controlling your blood sugar levels every day. This will help keep nerve and blood vessel damage from getting worse. The next step is to keep the skin of your feet healthy.\\nGood foot care for people with diabetes includes:\\n\\nChecking your feet every day. Look for cuts, redness, and other changes in the skin and toenails, including warts or other spots that your shoes could rub. Make sure to check the bottoms of your feet too.\\nWashing your feet every day. Use warm water and soap. Don't soak your feet because that can dry out your skin. After you dry your feet, you can use talcum powder or cornstarch between your toes. They soak up moisture that can cause infection. If you use lotion, don't apply it between your toes.\\nAsking your doctor how to remove corns and calluses safely. Thick skin on your feet can rub and lead to sores. But removing it the wrong way could damage your skin. So you don't want to cut the skin or use medicated pads or liquid removers.\\nTrimming your toenails straight across with a clipper. If it's hard for you to trim your own toenails, or if they're thick or curve into the skin, have a podiatrist (foot doctor) do it for you.\\nAlways wearing well-fitting shoes and socks or slippers to protect your feet when walking. You don't want to walk barefoot, even indoors. And be sure your shoes are smooth inside. A seam or pebble could rub your skin raw.\\nProtecting your feet from heat and cold. Use sunscreen on exposed skin and don't walk barefoot at the beach. In cold weather, wear warm socks instead of warming your feet near a heater or fireplace.\\nKeeping the blood flowing in your feet. Put your feet up when you're sitting. Wiggle your toes and circle your feet throughout the day. Don't wear tight socks. And get plenty of activity that's not too hard on the feet, such as walking.\\nGetting your feet checked at your health care visits. Even if you haven't noticed a problem, it's good to have your health care provider look at your feet.\\n\\nWhen should I see my health care provider about diabetic foot problems?\\nSerious foot problems can develop quickly. See your health care provider right away if you notice:\\n\\nA cut, blister, or bruise on your feet that doesn't start to heal in a few days\\nRed, warm, or painful skin on your feet\\nA callus with dried blood inside\\nA foot infection that becomes black and smells bad that could be gangrene\\n\\nRemember, controlling your blood sugar and caring for your feet every day are the best steps you can take to prevent serious diabetic foot problems.\\nNIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases\\n\",\n",
       " 'Pheochromocytoma': '\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nPheochromocytoma is a rare tumor that usually starts in the cells of one of your adrenal glands.

       " 'Floods': '\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nFloods are common in the United States.  Weather such as heavy rain, thunderstorms, hurricanes, or tsunamis can cause flooding.  Flooding can also happen when a river or stream overflows its bank, when a levee is breached, or when a dam breaks. Flash floods, which can develop quickly, often have a dangerous wall of roaring water.  The wall carries rocks, mud, and rubble and can sweep away most things in its path.\\nBe aware of flood hazards no matter where you live, but especially if you live in a low-lying area, near water or downstream from a dam.  Although there are no guarantees of safety during a flood, you can take actions to protect yourself.  You should have a disaster plan. Being prepared can help reduce fear, anxiety, and losses.

       " 'Pulmonary Embolism': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nWhat is a pulmonary embolism (PE)?\\nA pulmonary embolism (PE) is a sudden blockage in a lung artery. It usually happens when a blood clot breaks loose and travels through the bloodstream to the lungs. PE is a serious condition that can cause:\\nPermanent damage to the lungs\\nLow oxygen levels in your blood\\nDamage to other organs in your body from not getting enough oxygen\\n\\nPE can be life-threatening, especially if a clot is large, or if there are many clots.\\nWhat causes a pulmonary embolism (PE)?\\nThe cause is usually a blood clot in the leg called a deep vein thrombosis that breaks loose and travels through the bloodstream to the lungs.\\nWho is at risk for a pulmonary embolism (PE)?\\nAnyone can get a pulmonary embolism (PE), but certain things can raise your risk of PE:\\nHaving surgery, especially joint replacement surgery\\nCertain medical conditions, including\\n\\nCancers\\nHeart diseases\\nLung diseases\\nA broken hip or leg bone or other trauma\\n\\nHormone-based medicines, such as birth control pills or hormone replacement therapy\\nPregnancy and childbirth. The risk is highest for about six weeks after childbirth.\\nNot moving for long periods, such as being on bed rest, having a cast, or taking a long plane flight\\nAge. Your risk increases as you get older, especially after age 40.\\nFamily history and genetics. Certain genetic changes that can increase your risk of blood clots and PE.\\nObesity\\n\\nWhat are the symptoms of a pulmonary embolism (PE)?\\nHalf the people who have pulmonary embolism have no symptoms. If you do have symptoms, they can include shortness of breath, chest pain or coughing up blood. Symptoms of a blood clot include warmth, swelling, pain, tenderness and redness of the leg.\\nHow is a pulmonary embolism (PE) diagnosed?\\nIt can be difficult to diagnose PE. To make a diagnosis, your health care provider will:\\nTake your medical history, including asking about your symptoms and risk factors for PE\\nDo a physical exam\\nRun some tests, including various imaging tests and possibly some blood tests\\n\\nWhat are the treatments for a pulmonary embolism (PE)?\\nIf you have PE, you need medical treatment right away. The goal of treatment is to break up clots and help keep other clots from forming. Treatment options include medicines and procedures.\\nMedicines:\\nAnticoagulants, or blood thinners, keep blood clots from getting larger and stop new clots from forming. You might get them as an injection, a pill, or through an I.V. (intravenous). They can cause bleeding, especially if you are taking other medicines that also thin your blood, such as aspirin.\\nThrombolytics are medicines to dissolve blood clots. You may get them if you have large clots that cause severe symptoms or other serious complications. Thrombolytics can cause sudden bleeding, so they are used if your PE is serious and may be life-threatening.\\n\\nProcedures:\\nCatheter-assisted thrombus removal uses a flexible tube to reach a blood clot in your lung. Your health care provider can insert a tool in the tube to break up the clot or to deliver medicine through the tube. Usually you will get medicine to put you to sleep for this procedure.\\nA vena cava filter may be used in some people who cannot take blood thinners. Your health care provider inserts a filter inside a large vein called the vena cava. The filter catches blood clots before they travel to the lungs, which prevents pulmonary embolism. But the filter does not stop new blood clots from forming.\\n\\nCan pulmonary embolism (PE) be prevented?\\nPreventing new blood clots can prevent PE. Prevention may include:\\nContinuing to take blood thinners. It's also important to get regular checkups with your provider, to make sure that the dosage of your medicines is working to prevent blood clots but not causing bleeding.\\nHeart-healthy lifestyle changes, such as heart-healthy eating, exercise, and, if you smoke, quitting smoking\\nUsing compression stockings to prevent deep vein thrombosis (DVT)\\nMoving your legs when sitting for long periods of time (such as on long trips)\\nMoving around as soon as possible after surgery or being confined to a bed\\n\\nNIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute\\n\",\n",

       " 'Cancer': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nCancer begins in your cells, which are the building blocks of your body.   Normally, your body forms new cells as you need them, replacing old cells that die. Sometimes this process goes wrong. New cells grow even when you don't need them, and old cells don't die when they should. These extra cells can form a mass called a tumor. Tumors can be benign or malignant. Benign tumors aren't cancer while malignant ones are. Cells from malignant tumors can invade nearby tissues. They can also break away and spread to other parts of the body. \\nCancer is not just one disease but many diseases. There are more than 100 different types of cancer. Most cancers are named for where they start. For example, lung cancer starts in the lung, and breast cancer starts in the breast. The spread of cancer from one part of the body to another is called metastasis. Symptoms and treatment depend on the cancer type and how advanced it is. Most treatment plans may include surgery, radiation and/or chemotherapy. Some may involve hormone therapy, immunotherapy or other types of biologic therapy, or stem cell transplantation. \\nNIH: National Cancer Institute\\n\",\n",

       " 'Body Lice': '\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nWhat are body lice?\\nBody lice (also called clothes lice) are tiny insects which live and lay nits (lice eggs) on clothing. They are parasites, and they need to feed on human blood to survive. They usually only move to the skin to feed.\\nBody lice are one of the three types of lice that live on humans. The other two types are head lice and pubic lice. Each type of lice is different, and getting one type does not mean that you will get another type.\\nBody lice can spread diseases, such as typhus, trench fever, and relapsing fever.\\nHow do body lice spread?\\nBody lice move by crawling, because they cannot hop or fly. One way that they spread is through physical contact with a person who has body lice. They can also spread through contact with clothing, beds, bed linens, or towels that were used by a person with body lice. You cannot get lice from animals.\\nWho is at risk for body lice?\\nBody lice is most common in people who cannot bathe and wash their clothes regularly, especially if they live in crowded conditions. In the United States, this is most often people experiencing homelessness. In other countries, body lice can also affect refugees and victims of war or natural disasters.\\nWhat are the symptoms of body lice?\\nThe most common symptom of body lice is intense itching. There may also be a rash, which is caused by an allergic reaction to the bites. The itching causes some people to scratch until they get sores. Sometimes these sores can become infected with bacteria or fungi.\\nIf someone has body lice for a long time, the heavily bitten areas of their skin can become thickened and discolored. This is most common around your midsection (waist, groin, and upper thighs).\\nHow do you know if you have body lice?\\nA diagnosis of body lice usually comes from finding nits and crawling lice in the seams of clothing. Sometimes a body louse can be seen crawling or feeding on the skin. Other times it takes a magnifying lens to see the lice or nits.\\nWhat are the treatments for body lice?\\nThe main treatment for body lice is to improve personal hygiene. That means regular showers and washing clothes, bedding, and towels at least once a week. Use hot water to wash the laundry, and dry it using the hot cycle of the dryer. Some people may also need a lice-killing medicine.\\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention\\n',\n",
       " 'Heart Health Tests': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nHeart diseases are the number one killer in the U.S. They are also a major cause of disability. If you do have a heart disease, it is important to find it early, when it is easier to treat. Blood tests and heart health tests can help find heart diseases or identify problems that can lead to heart diseases. There are several different types of heart health tests. Your doctor will decide which test or tests you need, based on your symptoms (if any), risk factors, and medical history.\\nCardiac Catheterization\\nCardiac catheterization is a medical procedure used to diagnose and treat some heart conditions. For the procedure, your doctor puts a catheter (a long, thin, flexible tube) into a blood vessel in your arm, groin, or neck, and threads it to your heart. The doctor can use the catheter to:\\nDo a coronary angiography. This involves putting a special type of dye in the catheter, so the dye can flow through your bloodstream to your heart. Then your doctor takes x-rays of your heart. The dye allows your doctor to see your coronary arteries on the x-ray, and to check for coronary artery disease (plaque buildup in the arteries).\\nTake samples of blood and heart muscle\\nDo procedures such as minor heart surgery or angioplasty, if your doctor finds that you need it\\n\\nCardiac CT Scan\\nA cardiac CT (computed tomography) scan is a painless imaging test that uses x-rays to take detailed pictures of your heart and its blood vessels. Computers can combine these pictures to create a three-dimensional (3D) model of the whole heart. This test can help doctors detect or evaluate:\\nCoronary artery disease\\nCalcium buildup in the coronary arteries\\nProblems with the aorta\\nProblems with heart function and valves\\nPericardial diseases\\n\\nBefore you have the test, you get an injection of contrast dye. The dye highlights your heart and blood vessels in the pictures. The CT scanner is a large, tunnel-like machine. You lie still on a table which slides you into the scanner, and the scanner takes the pictures for about 15 minutes.\\nCardiac MRI\\nCardiac MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) is a painless imaging test that uses radio waves, magnets, and a computer to create detailed pictures of your heart. It can help your doctor figure out whether you have heart disease, and if so, how severe it is. A cardiac MRI can also help your doctor decide the best way to treat heart problems such as:\\nCoronary artery disease\\nHeart valve problems\\nPericarditis\\nCardiac tumors\\nDamage from a heart attack\\n\\nThe MRI is a large, tunnel-like machine. You lie still on a table which slides you into the MRI machine. The machine makes loud noises as it takes pictures of your heart. It usually takes about 30-90 minutes. Sometimes before the test, you might get an injection of contrast dye. The dye highlights your heart and blood vessels in the pictures.\\nChest X-Ray\\nA chest x-ray creates pictures of the organs and structures inside your chest, such as your heart, lungs, and blood vessels. It can reveal signs of heart failure, as well as lung disorders and other causes of symptoms not related to heart disease.\\nCoronary Angiography\\nCoronary angiography (angiogram) is a procedure that uses contrast dye and x-ray pictures to look at the insides of your arteries. It can show whether plaque is blocking your arteries and how severe the blockage is. Doctors use this procedure to diagnose heart diseases after chest pain, sudden cardiac arrest (SCA), or abnormal results from other heart tests such as an EKG or a stress test.\\nYou usually have a cardiac catheterization to get the dye into your coronary arteries. Then you have special x-rays while the dye is flowing through your coronary arteries. The dye lets your doctor study the flow of blood through your heart and blood vessels.\\nEchocardiography\\nEchocardiography, or echo, is a painless test that uses sound waves to create moving pictures of your heart. The pictures show the size and shape of your heart. They also show how well your heart's chambers and valves are working. Doctors use an echo to diagnose many different heart problems, and to check how severe they are.\\nFor the test, a technician applies gel to your chest. The gel helps sound waves reach your heart. The technician moves a transducer (wand-like device) around on your chest. The transducer connects to a computer. It transmits ultrasound waves into your chest, and the waves bounce (echo) back. The computer converts the echoes into pictures of your heart.\\nElectrocardiogram (EKG), (ECG)\\nAn electrocardiogram, also called an ECG or EKG, is a painless test that detects and records your heart's electrical activity. It shows how fast your heart is beating and whether its rhythm is steady or irregular.\\nAn EKG may be part of a routine exam to screen for heart disease. Or you may get it to detect and study heart problems such as heart attacks, arrhythmia, and heart failure.\\nFor the test, you lie still on a table and a nurse or technician attaches electrodes (patches that have sensors) to the skin on your chest, arms, and legs. Wires connect the electrodes to a machine that records your heart's electrical activity.\\nStress Testing\\nStress testing looks at how your heart works during physical stress. It can help to diagnose coronary artery disease, and to check how severe it is. It can also check for other problems, including heart valve disease and heart failure.\\nFor the test, you exercise (or are given medicine if you are unable to exercise) to make your heart work hard and beat fast. While this is happening, you get an EKG and blood pressure monitoring. Sometimes you may also have an echocardiogram, or other imaging tests such as a nuclear scan. For the nuclear scan, you get an injection of a tracer (a radioactive substance), which travels to your heart. Special cameras detect the energy from the tracer to make pictures of your heart. You have pictures taken after you exercise, and then after you rest.\\nNIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute\\n\",\n",

This prevents these organs from working properly.\\nThere are three types:\\n\\nType 1, the most common form, causes liver and spleen enlargement, bone pain and fractures (broken bones), and, sometimes, lung and kidney problems. It does not affect the brain. It can occur at any age.\\nType 2, which causes severe brain damage, appears in infants. Most children who have it die by age 2.\\nIn type 3, there may be liver and spleen enlargement. The brain is gradually affected. It usually starts in childhood or adolescence.\\n\\nGaucher disease has no cure. Treatment options for types 1 and 3 include medicine and enzyme replacement therapy, which is usually very effective. There is no good treatment for the brain damage of types 2 and 3.\\nNIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke\\n',\n",
       " 'Uterine Diseases': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nThe uterus, or womb, is the place where a baby grows when a woman is pregnant. The first sign of a problem with the uterus may be bleeding between periods or after sex. Causes can include hormones, thyroid problems, fibroids, polyps, cancer, infection, or pregnancy.\\nTreatment depends on the cause. Sometimes birth control pills treat hormonal imbalances. If a thyroid problem is the cause, treating it may also stop the bleeding. If you have cancer or hyperplasia, an overgrowth of normal cells in the uterus, you may need surgery.\\nWith two other uterine problems, tissue that normally lines the uterus grows where it is not supposed to.  In endometriosis, it grows outside the uterus.  In adenomyosis, it grows in the uterus's outside walls. Pain medicine may help. Other treatments include hormones and surgery.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Chronic Fatigue Syndrome': '\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nWhat is chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS)?\\nChronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is a serious, long-term illness that affects many body systems. Another name for it is myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). CFS can often make you unable to do your usual activities. Sometimes you may not even be able to get out of bed.\\nWhat causes chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS)?\\nThe cause of CFS is unknown. There may be more than one thing that causes it. It is possible that two or more triggers might work together to cause the illness.\\nWho is at risk for chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS)?\\nAnyone can get CFS, but it is most common in people between 40 and 60 years old. Adult women have it more often that adult men. Whites are more likely than other races to get a diagnosis of CFS, but many people with CFS have not been diagnosed with it.\\nWhat are the symptoms of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS)?\\nCFS symptoms can include:\\nSevere fatigue that is not improved by rest\\nSleep problems\\nPost-exertional malaise (PEM), where your symptoms get worse after any physical or mental activity\\nProblems with thinking and concentrating\\nPain\\nDizziness\\n\\nCFS can be unpredictable. Your symptoms may come and go. They may change over time - sometimes they might get better, and other times they may get worse.\\nHow is chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) diagnosed?\\nCFS can be difficult to diagnose. There is no specific test for CFS, and other illnesses can cause similar symptoms. Your health care provider has to rule out other diseases before making a diagnosis of CFS. He or she will do a thorough medical exam, including:\\nAsking about your medical history and your family\\'s medical history\\nAsking about your current illness, including your symptoms. Your doctor will want to know how often you have symptoms, how bad they are, how long they have lasted, and how they affect your life.\\nA thorough physical and mental status exam\\nBlood, urine, or other tests\\n\\nWhat are the treatments for chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS)?\\nThere is no cure or approved treatment for CFS, but you may be able to treat or manage some of your symptoms. You, your family, and your health care provider should work together to decide on a plan. You should figure out which symptom causes the most problems and try to treat that first. For example, if sleep problems affect you the most, you might first try using good sleep habits. If those do not help, you may need to take medicines or see a sleep specialist.\\nStrategies such as learning new ways to manage activity can also be helpful. You need to make sure that you do not \"push and crash.\" This can happen when you feel better, do too much, and then get worse again.\\nSince the process of developing a treatment plan and attending to self-care can be hard if you have CFS, it is important to have support from family members and friends.\\nDon\\'t try any new treatments without talking to your health care provider. Some treatments that are promoted as cures for CFS are unproven, often costly, and could be dangerous.\\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention\\n',\n",

Doctors may use the A1C alone or in combination with other diabetes tests to make a diagnosis. They also use the A1C to see how well you are managing your diabetes. This test is different from the blood sugar checks that people with diabetes do every day.\\nYour A1C test result is given in percentages. The higher the percentage, the higher your blood sugar levels have been:\\n\\nA normal A1C level is below 5.7%\\nPrediabetes is between 5.7 to 6.4%. Having prediabetes is a risk factor for getting type 2 diabetes. People with prediabetes may need retests every year.\\nType 2 diabetes is above 6.5%\\nIf you have diabetes, you should have the A1C test at least twice a year. The A1C goal for many people with diabetes is below 7. It may be different for you. Ask what your goal should be.

       " 'Healthy Sleep': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nWhat is sleep?\\nWhile you are sleeping, you are unconscious, but your brain and body functions are still active. Sleep is a complex biological process that helps you process new information, stay healthy, and feel rested.\\nDuring sleep, your brain cycles through five stages: stage 1, 2, 3, 4, and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Different things happen during each stage. For example, you have a different pattern of brain waves during each one. Your breathing, heart, and temperature may be slower or faster in some stages. Certain phases of sleep help you :\\nFeel rested and energetic the next day\\nLearn information, get insight, and form memories\\nGive your heart and vascular system a rest\\nRelease more growth hormone, which helps children grow. It also boosts muscle mass and the repair of cells and tissues in children and adults.\\nRelease sex hormones, which contributes to puberty and fertility\\nKeep from getting sick or help you get better when you are sick, by creating more cytokines (hormones that help the immune system fight various infections)\\n\\nYou need all of the stages to get a healthy sleep.\\nHow much sleep do I need?\\nThe amount of sleep you need depends on several factors, including your age, lifestyle, health, and whether you have been getting enough sleep recently. The general recommendations for sleep are:\\nNewborns: 16-18 hours a day\\nPreschool-aged children: 11-12 hours a day\\nSchool-aged children: At least 10 hours a day\\nTeens: 9-10 hours a day\\nAdults (including older adults): 7-8 hours a day\\n\\nDuring puberty, teenagers' biological clocks shift, and they are more likely to go to bed later than younger children and adults, and they tend to want to sleep later in the morning. This delayed sleep-wake rhythm conflicts with the early-morning start times of many high schools and helps explain why most teenagers do not get enough sleep.\\nSome people think that adults need less sleep as they age. But there is no evidence to show that older adults can get by with less sleep than people who are younger. As people age, however, they often get less sleep or they tend to spend less time in the deep, restful stage of sleep. Older adults are also more easily awakened.\\nAnd it's not just the number of hours of sleep you get that matters. The quality of the sleep you get is also important. People whose sleep is frequently interrupted or cut short might not get enough of certain stages of sleep.\\nIf you are wondering whether you are getting enough sleep, including quality sleep, ask yourself:\\nDo you have trouble getting up in the morning?\\nDo you have trouble focusing during the day?\\nDo you doze off during the day?\\n\\nIf you answered yes to these three questions, you should work on improving your sleep.\\nWhat are the health effects of not getting enough sleep?\\nSleep is important for overall health. When you don't get enough sleep (sleep deprivation), it does more than just make you feel tired. It can affect your performance, including your ability to think clearly, react quickly, and form memories. This may cause you to make bad decisions and take more risks. People with sleep deprivation are more likely to get into accidents.\\nSleep deprivation can also affect your mood, leading to:\\nIrritability\\nProblems with relationships, especially for children and teenagers\\nDepression\\nAnxiety\\n\\nIt can also affect your physical health. Research shows that not getting enough sleep, or getting poor-quality sleep, increases your risk of:\\nHigh blood pressure\\nHeart disease\\nStroke\\nKidney disease\\nObesity\\nType 2 diabetes\\n\\nNot getting enough sleep can also mean that you don't get enough of the hormones that help children grow and help adults and children build muscle mass, fight infections, and repair cells.\\nSleep deprivation magnifies the effect of alcohol. A tired person who drinks too much alcohol will be more impaired than a well-rested person.\\nHow can I get better sleep?\\nYou can take steps to improve your sleep habits. First, make sure that you allow yourself enough time to sleep. With enough sleep each night, you may find that you're happier and more productive during the day.\\nTo improve your sleep habits, it also may help to:\\nGo to bed and wake up at the same time every day\\nAvoid caffeine, especially in the afternoon and evening\\nAvoid nicotine\\nExercise regularly, but don't exercise too late in the day\\nAvoid alcoholic drinks before bed\\nAvoid large meals and beverages late at night\\nDon't take a nap after 3 p.m.\\nRelax before bed, for example by taking a bath, reading or listening to relaxing music\\nKeep the temperature in your bedroom cool\\nGet rid of distractions such as noises, bright lights, and a TV or computer in the bedroom. Also, don't be tempted to go on your phone or tablet just before bed.\\nGet enough sunlight exposure during the day\\nDon't lie in bed awake; if you can't sleep for 20 minutes, get up and do something relaxing\\nSee a doctor if you have continued trouble sleeping. You may have a sleep disorder, such as insomnia or sleep apnea.  In some cases, your doctor may suggest trying over-the-counter or prescription sleep aid. In other cases, your doctor may want you to do a sleep study, to help diagnose the problem.\\n\\nIf you are a shift worker, it can be even harder to get a good sleep. You may also want to:\\nTake naps and increase the amount of time available for sleep\\nKeep the lights bright at work\\nLimit shift changes so your body clock can adjust\\nLimit caffeine use to the first part of your shift\\nRemove sound and light distractions in your bedroom during daytime sleep (for example, use light-blocking curtains)\\n\\n\",\n",
       " 'How to Prevent Diabetes': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nWhat is type 2 diabetes?\\nIf you have diabetes, your blood sugar levels are too high. With type 2 diabetes, this happens because your body does not make enough insulin, or it does not use insulin well (this is called insulin resistance). If you are at risk for type 2 diabetes, you might be able to prevent or delay developing it.\\nWho is at risk for type 2 diabetes?\\nMany Americans are at risk for type 2 diabetes. Your chances of getting it depend on a combination of risk factors such as your genes and lifestyle. The risk factors include:\\nHaving prediabetes, which means you have blood sugar levels that are higher than normal but not high enough to be called diabetes\\nBeing overweight or having obesity\\nBeing age 45 or older\\nA family history of diabetes\\nBeing African American, Alaska Native, American Indian, Asian American, Hispanic/Latino, Native Hawaiian, or Pacific Islander\\nHaving high blood pressure\\nHaving a low level of HDL (good) cholesterol or a high level of triglycerides\\nA history of diabetes in pregnancy\\nHaving given birth to a baby weighing 9 pounds or more\\nAn inactive lifestyle\\nA history of heart disease or stroke\\nHaving depression\\nHaving polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)\\nHaving acanthosis nigricans, a skin condition in which your skin becomes dark and thick, especially around your neck or armpits\\nSmoking\\n\\nHow can I prevent or delay getting type 2 diabetes?\\nIf you are at risk for diabetes, you may be able to prevent or delay getting it. Most of the things that you need to do involve having a healthier lifestyle. So if you make these changes, you will get other health benefits as well. You may lower your risk of other diseases, and you will probably feel better and have more energy. The changes are:\\nLosing weight and keeping it off. Weight control is an important part of diabetes prevention. You may be able to prevent or delay diabetes by losing 5 to 10% of your current weight. For example, if you weigh 200 pounds, your goal would be to lose between 10 to 20 pounds. And once you lose the weight, it is important that you don't gain it back.\\nFollowing a healthy eating plan. It is important to reduce the amount of calories you eat and drink each day, so you can lose weight and keep it off. To do that, your diet should include smaller portions and less fat and sugar. You should also eat a variety of foods from each food group, including plenty of whole grains, fruits, and vegetables. It's also a good idea to limit red meat, and avoid processed meats.\\nGet regular exercise. Exercise has many health benefits, including helping you to lose weight and lower your blood sugar levels. These both lower your risk of type 2 diabetes. Try to get at least 30 minutes of physical activity 5 days a week. If you have not been active, talk with your health care professional to figure out which types of exercise are best for you. You can start slowly and work up to your goal.\\nDon't smoke. Smoking can contribute to insulin resistance, which can lead to type 2 diabetes. If you already smoke, try to quit.\\nTalk to your health care provider to see whether there is anything else you can do to delay or to prevent type 2 diabetes. If you are at high risk, your provider may suggest that you take one of a few types of diabetes medicines.\\n\\nNIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases\\n\",\n",

So, there are two types of TB conditions:\\n\\nLatent TB infection, where the TB germs live in your body but don't make you sick.\\nTB disease (active TB) where you get sick from the TB germs. TB disease can almost always be cured with antibiotics. But if it's not treated properly, it can be fatal.\\n\\nTB is found in the U.S., but it is more common in certain other countries.\\nWhat causes tuberculosis (TB)?\\nTB is caused by bacteria (germs) called Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The germs spread from person to person through the air. People who have TB disease in their throat or lungs spread the germs in the air when they cough, sneeze, talk, or sing. If you breathe in the air that has the germs, you can get TB. TB is not spread by touching, kissing, or sharing food or dishes.\\nYou're more likely to catch TB from people you live or work with than from people you see for shorter amounts of time.\\nWho is more likely to get infected with tuberculosis (TB) germs?\\nAnyone who is near a person with TB disease can get infected with the germs. You are more likely to be near someone with TB disease if you:\\n\\nWere born in or often travel to countries where TB disease is common\\nAre a health care worker\\nWork or live in a place where TB is more common, such as shelters for people without homes, jails, and nursing homes\\n\\nWho is more likely to develop TB disease?\\nCertain people are more likely to get sick with TB disease after they get infected. They include people who:\\n\\nHave HIV/AIDS\\nBecame infected with TB in the last 2 years\\nHave other diseases, such as diabetes, that make it hard for your body to fight TB germs\\nHave alcohol use disorder or inject illegal drugs\\nWere not treated correctly for TB in the past\\nAre under age 5\\nAre an older adult\\n\\nWhat are the symptoms of tuberculosis (TB)?\\nMost people who have TB germs in their bodies don't get sick with TB disease. Instead, they have latent TB infection. With a latent TB infection, you:\\n\\nDon't have symptoms\\nCan't spread TB to others\\nCould get sick with active TB disease in the future if your immune system becomes weak for another reason\\nNeed to take medicine to prevent getting sick with active TB disease in the future\\n\\nIf you have TB disease, the TB germs are active, meaning that they are growing (multiplying) inside your body and making you sick. If the TB is growing in your lungs or throat, you can spread the TB germs to other people. You can get sick with TB disease weeks to years after you're infected with TB germs.\\nWith TB disease, your symptoms will depend on where the TB is growing in your body\\n\\nGeneral symptoms may include: \\n\\t\\nChills and fever\\nNight sweats (heavy sweating during sleep)\\nLosing weight without trying\\nLoss of appetite\\nWeakness or fatigue\\n\\n\\nSymptoms from TB disease in your lungs may include:\\n\\t\\nA cough that lasts longer than 3 weeks\\nCoughing up blood or sputum (a thick mucus from the lungs)\\nChest pain\\n\\n\\n\\nHow is tuberculosis (TB) diagnosed?\\nYour health care provider or your local health department can test you to find out if you have TB germs in your body. They will give you either a TB skin or blood test.\\nIf your test shows that you have TB germs, you'll need to have other tests to see if the germs are actively growing:\\n\\nTests for TB disease in the lungs usually include testing samples of your sputum and having chest x-rays.\\nTests for TB disease in other parts of your body may include tests of urine and tissue samples.\\n\\nYou may need a TB test if you have symptoms of TB disease or if you are at high risk because you are more likely to be near someone with TB disease.\\nWhat is the treatment for tuberculosis (TB)?\\nThe treatment for both latent TB infection and TB disease is antibiotics. To make sure you get rid of all the TB germs in your body, it's very important to follow the directions for taking your medicine.\\nIf you don't follow the directions, the TB germs in your body could change and become antibiotic resistant. That means the medicine may stop working and your TB may become hard to cure.\\n\\nFor latent TB infections, you usually take medicines for 3 to 9 months. Treatment helps make sure you don't get TB disease in the future.\\nFor active TB disease, you usually need to take medicines for 6 to 12 months. Treatment will almost always cure you if you take your pills the right way.\\nFor TB disease in your lungs or throat, you'll need to stay home for a few weeks, so you don't spread disease to other people. You can protect the people you live with by: \\n\\t\\nCovering your nose and mouth.\\nOpening windows when possible.\\nNot getting too close to them.\\n\\n\\n\\nBy following medical advice for TB testing and treatment, you can keep yourself healthy and help stop the spread of TB.\\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention\\n\",\n",
       " 'Enlarged Prostate (BPH)': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nWhat is the prostate?\\nThe prostate is a gland in the male reproductive system. It lies just below the bladder. It makes fluid that is part of semen.\\nWhat is an enlarged prostate (BPH)?\\nAn enlarged prostate is when your prostate gland becomes larger than normal. It's also called benign prostatic hyperplasia or BPH for short. Benign means not cancer. And hyperplasia means too much cell growth. BPH isn't cancer and it doesn't increase your risk of getting prostate cancer.\\nUsually, the prostate gland continues to grow during adult life. That's why BPH is the most common prostate condition in people over age 50. As the prostate gets bigger, it may press against the bladder and pinch the urethra. This can slow or block the flow of urine out of your bladder.\\nOver time, the bladder muscle may become weak from trying to pass urine through a narrow urethra.  When this happens, your bladder may not empty completely when you urinate. A narrowed urethra and weak bladder cause many of the urinary problems you may have with BPH.\\nWhat causes an enlarged prostate (BPH)?\\nResearchers aren't sure why the prostate keeps growing. Some researchers think changes in hormones with aging may cause the prostate to get bigger.\\nWho is more likely to develop BPH?\\nYou're more likely to develop BPH if you:\\n\\nAre age 40 or older. The chance of getting BPH increases as you get older.\\nHave family members who have had BPH.\\nHave certain health conditions such as:\\n\\t\\nObesity.\\nHeart disease and problems with blood circulation.\\nType 2 diabetes.\\nErectile dysfunction.\\n\\n\\nDon't get enough physical activity.\\n\\nWhat are the symptoms of BPH?\\nSymptoms of BPH include:\\n\\nHaving a frequent or urgent need to urinate\\nWaking up many times to urinate\\nHaving problems with urine flow, such as:\\n\\t\\nTrouble starting to urinate\\nA stream that's weak, slow, or stops and starts\\nDribbling after urination\\nUrinary incontinence\\nFeeling that you can't completely empty your bladder\\n\\n\\nPain after ejaculation or during urination\\nUrine with an unusual color or smell\\n\\nIt's important to see your health care provider if you have any of these symptoms because they could be from a more serious health problem.\\nYou should get medical help right away if you:\\n\\nCan't urinate at all\\nHave fever and chills with urination that's painful, frequent, and urgent\\nHave blood in your urine\\nHave pain in your lower abdomen (belly) and urinary tract\\n\\nWhat other problems can BPH cause?\\nFor most people, BPH doesn't cause other problems. But BPH increases your chance of developing serious conditions, including:\\n\\nAcute urinary retention. With this condition, you suddenly can't urinate at all. This a medical emergency.  Acute urinary retention is common in older males and the chance of having it increases with age. It may be triggered by:\\n\\t\\nTaking certain over-the-counter cold or allergy medicines\\nDrinking alcohol\\nCold temperatures\\nNot moving enough over a long period of time\\n\\n\\nUrinary tract infections (UTIs)\\nBladder damage and bladder stones\\nKidney damage\\n\\nHow is BPH diagnosed?\\nTo find out if you have BPH, your provider will:\\n\\nAsk about your medical history. Be sure to tell your provider about all the medicines you take, because certain medicines can make BPH symptoms worse.\\nAsk about your family health history.\\nExamine you. The exam may include a digital rectal exam (DRE) of your prostate. In a DRE, your provider inserts a gloved finger into your rectum to check if your prostate is large, tender, or irregular in any other way.\\nOrder medical tests, if needed, such as:\\n\\t\\t\\nUrine tests.\\nA PSA blood test (prostate-specific antigen test).\\nUrodynamic testing to see how well you can hold and release urine.\\nCystoscopy to look inside your urethra and bladder.\\nUltrasound pictures of your prostate and urinary tract.\\nA prostate biopsy to diagnose or rule out prostate cancer.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat are the treatments for BPH?\\nNot everyone needs treatment for BPH. Treatment options depend on how much your symptoms bother you, your health, age, and the size of your prostate:\\n\\nLifestyle changes may improve mild symptoms. They include:\\n\\nDrinking less before bedtime or going out\\nAvoiding or cutting back on beverages with caffeine and alcohol\\nBladder training and exercising the muscles that control urine flow\\nPreventing or treating constipation\\n\\n\\n\\nMedicines can help mild to moderate symptoms by:\\n\\nStopping the prostate from growing\\nShrinking the prostate\\nRelaxing muscles to improve urine flow\\n\\n\\nSometimes combining 2 types of medicine helps more than taking just one type of medicine.\\n\\nMedical procedures can help improve moderate to severe BPH symptoms when medicines don't help enough. There are several different types of procedures. They all use an instrument inserted into the urethra to either:\\n\\nWiden the urethra\\nDestroy part of the prostate with heat\\n\\n\\n\\nSurgery may be helpful when symptoms are severe, other treatments haven't helped, or you have another problem, such as bladder damage. Different types of surgery are used to:\\n\\nRemove part or all of the prostate\\nMake cuts in the prostate to take pressure off the urethra\\n\\n\\nMost BPH surgery is done with tools inserted into the urethra.\\n\\n\\nYour provider can explain the possible benefits and side effects of your treatment options so you can decide what's best for you.\\nCan BPH be prevented?\\nResearchers haven't found ways to prevent BPH.

       " 'Marijuana': '\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nWhat is marijuana?\\nMarijuana is a green, brown, or gray mix of dried, crumbled parts from the marijuana plant.  The plant contains chemicals which act on your brain and can change your mood or consciousness.\\nHow do people use marijuana?\\nThere are many different ways that people use marijuana, including:\\nRolling it up and smoking it like a cigarette or cigar\\nSmoking it in a pipe\\nMixing it in food and eating it\\nBrewing it as a tea\\nSmoking oils from the plant (\"dabbing\")\\nUsing electronic vaporizers (\"vaping\")\\n\\nWhat are the effects of marijuana?\\nMarijuana can cause both short-term and long-term effects.\\nShort term:\\nWhile you are high, you may experience:\\nAltered senses, such as seeing brighter colors\\nAltered sense of time, such as minutes seeming like hours\\nChanges in mood\\nProblems with body movement\\nTrouble with thinking, problem-solving, and memory\\nIncreased appetite\\n\\nLong term:\\nIn the long term, marijuana can cause health problems, such as:\\nProblems with brain development. People who started using marijuana as teenagers may have trouble with thinking, memory, and learning.\\nCoughing and breathing problems, if you smoke marijuana frequently\\nProblems with child development during and after pregnancy, if a woman smokes marijuana while pregnant\\n\\nCan you overdose on marijuana?\\nIt is possible to overdose on marijuana, if you take a very high dose. Symptoms of an overdose include anxiety, panic, and a rapid heartbeat. In rare cases, an overdose can cause paranoia and hallucinations. There are no reports of people dying from using just marijuana.\\nIs marijuana addictive?\\nAfter using marijuana for a while, it is possible to get addicted to it. You are more likely to become addicted if you use marijuana every day or you started using it when you were a teenager. If you are addicted, you will have a strong need to take the drug. You may also need to smoke more and more of it to get the same high. When you try to quit, you may have mild withdrawal symptoms such as:\\nIrritability\\nTrouble sleeping\\nDecreased appetite\\nAnxiety\\nCravings\\n\\nWhat is medical marijuana?\\nThe marijuana plant has chemicals that can help with some health problems. More states are making it legal to use the plant as medicine for certain medical conditions. But there isn\\'t enough research to show that the whole plant works to treat or cure these conditions. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved the marijuana plant as a medicine. Marijuana is still illegal at the national level.\\nHowever, there have been scientific studies of cannabinoids, the chemicals in marijuana. The two main cannabinoids that are of medical interest are THC and CBD. The FDA has approved two drugs that contain THC. These drugs treat nausea caused by chemotherapy and increase appetite in patients who have severe weight loss from AIDS. There is also a liquid drug that contains CBD. It treats two forms of severe childhood epilepsy. Scientists are doing more research with marijuana and its ingredients to treat many diseases and conditions.\\nNIH: National Institute on Drug Abuse\\n',\n",
       " 'How to Prevent Heart Disease': '\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nHeart disease is the leading cause of the death in the United States. It is also a major cause of disability. There are many things that can raise your risk for heart disease. They are called risk factors. Some of them you cannot control, but there are many that you can control. Learning about them can lower your risk of heart disease.\\nWhat are the heart disease risk factors that I cannot change?\\n\\nAge. Your risk of heart disease increases as you get older. Men age 45 and older and women age 55 and older have a greater risk.\\nSex. Some risk factors may affect heart disease risk differently in women than in men. For example, estrogen provides women some protection against heart disease, but diabetes raises the risk of heart disease more in women than in men.\\nRace or ethnicity. Certain groups have higher risks than others. African Americans are more likely than whites to have heart disease, while Hispanic Americans are less likely to have it. Some Asian groups, such as East Asians, have lower rates, but South Asians have higher rates.\\nFamily history. You have a greater risk if you have a close family member who had heart disease at an early age.\\n\\nWhat can I do to lower my risk of heart disease?\\nFortunately, there are many things you can do to reduce your chances of getting heart disease:\\n\\nControl your blood pressure. High blood pressure is a major risk factor for heart disease. It is important to get your blood pressure checked regularly - at least once a year for most adults, and more often if you have high blood pressure. Take steps, including lifestyle changes, to prevent or control high blood pressure.\\nKeep your cholesterol and triglyceride levels under control. High levels of cholesterol can clog your arteries and raise your risk of coronary artery disease and heart attack. Lifestyle changes and medicines (if needed) can lower your cholesterol. Triglycerides are another type of fat in the blood. High  levels of triglycerides may also raise the risk of coronary artery disease, especially in women.\\nStay at a healthy weight. Being overweight or having obesity can increase your risk for heart disease. This is mostly because they are linked to other heart disease risk factors, including high blood cholesterol and triglyceride levels, high blood pressure, and diabetes. Controlling your weight can lower these risks.\\nEat a healthy diet. Try to limit saturated fats, foods high in sodium, and added sugars. Eat plenty of fresh fruit, vegetables, and whole grains. The DASH diet is an example of an eating plan that can help you to lower your blood pressure and cholesterol, two things that can lower your risk of heart disease.\\nGet regular exercise. Exercise has many benefits, including strengthening your heart and improving your circulation. It can also help you maintain a healthy weight and lower cholesterol and blood pressure. All of these can lower your risk of heart disease.\\nLimit alcohol. Drinking too much alcohol can raise your blood pressure. It also adds extra calories, which may cause weight gain. Both of those raise your risk of heart disease. Men should have no more than two alcoholic drinks per day, and women should not have more than one.\\nDon\\'t smoke. Cigarette smoking raises your blood pressure and puts you at higher risk for heart attack and stroke. If you do not smoke, do not start. If you do smoke, quitting will lower your risk for heart disease. You can talk with your health care provider for help in finding the best way for you to quit.\\nManage stress. Stress is linked to heart disease in many ways. It can raise your blood pressure. Extreme stress can be a \"trigger\" for a heart attack. Also, some common ways of coping with stress, such as overeating, heavy drinking, and smoking, are bad for your heart. Some ways to help manage your stress include exercise, listening to music, focusing on something calm or peaceful, and meditating.\\nManage diabetes. Having diabetes doubles your risk of diabetic heart disease. That is because over time, high blood sugar from diabetes can damage your blood vessels and the nerves that control your heart and blood vessels. So, it is important to get tested for diabetes, and if you have it, to keep it under control.\\nMake sure that you get enough sleep. If you don\\'t get enough sleep, you raise your risk of high blood pressure, obesity, and diabetes. Those three things can raise your risk for heart disease. Most adults need 7 to 9 hours of sleep per night. Make sure that you have good sleep habits. If you have frequent sleep problems, contact your health care provider. One problem, sleep apnea, causes people to briefly stop breathing many times during sleep. This interferes with your ability to get a good rest and can raise your risk of heart disease. If you think you might have it, ask your doctor about having a sleep study. And if you do have sleep apnea, make sure that you get treatment for it.\\n\\n',\n",
       " 'Psoriasis': '\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nPsoriasis is a skin disease that causes itchy or sore patches of thick, red skin with silvery scales. You usually get the patches on your elbows, knees, scalp, back, face, palms and feet, but they can show up on other parts of your body.  Some people who have psoriasis also get a form of arthritis called psoriatic arthritis.\\nA problem with your immune system causes psoriasis. In a process called cell turnover, skin cells that grow deep in your skin rise to the surface. Normally, this takes a month. In psoriasis, it happens in just days because your cells rise too fast. \\nPsoriasis can be hard to diagnose because it can look like other skin diseases. Your doctor might need to look at a small skin sample under a microscope.\\nPsoriasis can last a long time, even a lifetime. Symptoms come and go. Things that make them worse include:\\nInfections\\nStress\\nDry skin\\nCertain medicines\\n\\nPsoriasis usually occurs in adults. It sometimes runs in families. Treatments include creams, medicines, and light therapy.\\nNIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases \\n',\n",
       " 'Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nGranulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), previously known as Wegener's granulomatosis, is a rare disease. It is a type of vasculitis, or inflammation of the blood vessels. The inflammation limits the flow of blood to important organs, causing damage. It can affect any organ, but it mainly affects the sinuses, nose, trachea (windpipe), lungs, and kidneys. \\nThe cause of GPA is unknown.  It can affect people at any age. Men and women are equally affected. It is more common in whites. Symptoms may include joint pain, weakness, tiredness, and cold symptoms such as a runny nose that doesn't get better. Doctors use blood tests, chest X-rays, and biopsies to diagnose GPA and rule out other causes of the symptoms.\\nEarly treatment is important. Most people improve with medicines to slow or stop the inflammation. \\n\\n\",\n",
       " 'Rh Incompatibility': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nThere are four major blood types: A, B, O, and AB. The types are based on substances on the surface of the blood cells. Another blood type is called Rh. Rh factor is a protein on red blood cells.  Most people are Rh-positive; they have Rh factor.  Rh-negative people don't have it.  Rh factor is inherited through genes.\\nWhen you're pregnant, blood from your baby can cross into your bloodstream, especially during delivery. If you're Rh-negative and your baby is Rh-positive, your body will react to the baby's blood as a foreign substance.  It will create antibodies (proteins) against the baby's blood. These antibodies usually don't cause problems during a first pregnancy.\\nBut Rh incompatibility may cause problems in later pregnancies, if the baby is Rh-positive. This is because the antibodies stay in your body once they have formed.  The antibodies can cross the placenta and attack the baby's red blood cells.  The baby could get Rh disease, a serious condition that can cause a serious type of anemia.\\nBlood tests can tell whether you have Rh factor and whether your body has made antibodies. Injections of a medicine called Rh immune globulin can keep your body from making Rh antibodies. It helps prevent the problems of Rh incompatibility.  If treatment is needed for the baby, it can include supplements to help the body to make red blood cells and blood transfusions.\\nNIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute\\n\",\n",
       " 'Sickle Cell Disease': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nWhat is sickle cell disease (SCD)?\\nSickle cell disease (SCD) is a group of inherited red blood cell disorders. If you have SCD, there is a problem with your hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is a protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen throughout the body. With SCD, the hemoglobin forms into stiff rods within the red blood cells. This changes the shape of the red blood cells. The cells are supposed to be disc-shaped, but this changes them into a crescent, or sickle, shape.\\nThe sickle-shaped cells are not flexible and cannot change shape easily. Many of them burst apart as they move through your blood vessels. The sickle cells usually only last 10 to 20 days, instead of the normal 90 to 120 days. Your body may have trouble making enough new cells to replace the ones that you lost. Because of this, you may not have enough red blood cells. This is a condition called anemia, and it can make you feel tired.\\nThe sickle-shaped cells can also stick to vessel walls, causing a blockage that slows or stops the flow of blood. When this happens, oxygen can't reach nearby tissues. The lack of oxygen can cause attacks of sudden, severe pain, called pain crises. These attacks can occur without warning. If you get one, you might need to go to the hospital for treatment.\\nWhat causes sickle cell disease (SCD)?\\nThe cause of SCD is a defective gene, called a sickle cell gene. People with the disease are born with two sickle cell genes, one from each parent.\\nIf you are born with one sickle cell gene, it's called sickle cell trait. People with sickle cell trait are generally healthy, but they can pass the defective gene on to their children.\\nWho is at risk for sickle cell disease (SCD)?\\nIn the United States, most of the people with SCD are African Americans:\\nAbout 1 in 13 African American babies is born with sickle cell trait\\nAbout 1 in every 365 black children is born with sickle cell disease\\n\\nSCD also affects some people who come from Hispanic, southern European, Middle Eastern, or Asian Indian backgrounds.\\nWhat are the symptoms of sickle cell disease (SCD)?\\nPeople with SCD start to have signs of the disease during the first year of life, usually around 5 months of age. Early symptoms of SCD may include:\\nPainful swelling of the hands and feet\\nFatigue or fussiness from anemia\\nA yellowish color of the skin (jaundice) or the whites of the eyes (icterus)\\n\\nThe effects of SCD vary from person to person and can change over time. Most of the signs and symptoms of SCD are related to complications of the disease. They may include severe pain, anemia, organ damage, and infections.\\nHow is sickle cell disease (SCD) diagnosed?\\nA blood test can show if you have SCD or sickle cell trait. All states now test newborns as part of their screening programs, so treatment can begin early.\\nPeople who are thinking about having children can have the test to find out how likely it is that their children will have SCD.\\nDoctors can also diagnose SCD before a baby is born. That test uses a sample of amniotic fluid (the liquid in the sac surrounding the baby) or tissue taken from the placenta (the organ that brings oxygen and nutrients to the baby).\\nWhat are the treatments for sickle cell disease (SCD)?\\nThe only cure for SCD is bone marrow or stem cell transplantation. Because these transplants are risky and can have serious side effects, they are usually only used in children with severe SCD. For the transplant to work, the bone marrow must be a close match. Usually, the best donor is a brother or sister.\\nThere are treatments that can help relieve symptoms, lessen complications, and prolong life:\\nAntibiotics to try to prevent infections in younger children\\nPain relievers for acute or chronic pain\\nHydroxyurea, a medicine that has been shown to reduce or prevent several SCD complications. It increases the amount of fetal hemoglobin in the blood. This medicine is not right for everyone; talk to your health care provider about whether you should take it. This medicine is not safe during pregnancy.\\nChildhood vaccinations to prevent infections\\nBlood transfusions for severe anemia. If you have had some serious complications, such as a stroke, you may have transfusions to prevent more complications.\\n\\nThere are other treatments for specific complications.\\nTo stay as healthy as possible, make sure that you get regular medical care, live a healthy lifestyle, and avoid situations that may set off a pain crisis.\\nNIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute\\n\",\n",

You might have the disease for only a short time, or symptoms might come and go. The severe form can last a lifetime.\\nRheumatoid arthritis is different from osteoarthritis, the common arthritis that often comes with older age. RA can affect body parts besides joints, such as your eyes, mouth and lungs. RA is an autoimmune disease, which means the arthritis results from your immune system attacking your body's own tissues.\\nNo one knows what causes rheumatoid arthritis.

If the vein swells, the condition is called thrombophlebitis. A deep vein thrombosis can break loose and cause a serious problem in the lung,  called a pulmonary embolism.\\nSitting still for a long time can make you more likely to get a DVT. Some medicines and disorders that increase your risk for blood clots can also lead to DVTs. Common symptoms are :\\n Warmth and tenderness over the vein \\n Pain or swelling in the part of the body affected \\n Skin redness \\n\\nTreatment includes medicines to ease pain and inflammation, break up clots and keep new clots from forming.

They include strong prescription pain relievers, such as oxycodone, hydrocodone, fentanyl, and tramadol. The illegal drug heroin is also an opioid.\\nA health care provider may give you a prescription opioid to reduce pain after you have had a major injury or surgery. You may get them if you have severe pain from health conditions like cancer. Some health care providers prescribe them for chronic pain.\\nPrescription opioids used for pain relief are generally safe when taken for a short time and as prescribed by your health care provider. \\nHowever, people who take opioids are at risk for opioid dependence and addiction, as well as an overdose. These risks increase when opioids are misused. Misuse means you are not taking the medicines according to your provider's instructions, you are using them to get high, or you are taking someone else's opioids.\\nWhat is an opioid overdose?\\nOpioids affect the part of the brain that regulates breathing. When people take high doses of opioids, it can lead to an overdose, with the slowing or stopping of breathing and sometimes death.\\nWhat causes an opioid overdose?\\nAn opioid overdose can happen for a variety of reasons, including if you:\\nTake an opioid to get high\\nTake an extra dose of a prescription opioid or take it too often (either accidentally or on purpose)\\nMix an opioid with other medicines, illegal drugs, or alcohol. An overdose can be fatal when mixing an opioid and certain anxiety treatment medicines, such as Xanax or Valium.\\nTake an opioid medicine that was prescribed for someone else. Children are especially at risk of an accidental overdose if they take medicine not intended for them.\\n\\nThere is also a risk of overdose if you are getting medication-assisted treatment (MAT). MAT is a treatment for opioid abuse and addiction.

       " 'Mosquito Bites': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nMosquitoes are insects that live all over the world. There are thousands of different species of mosquitoes; about 200 of those live in the United States.\\nFemale mosquitoes bite animals and humans and drink a very small amount of their blood. They need protein and iron from blood to produce eggs. After drinking blood, they find some standing water and lay their eggs in it. The eggs hatch into larvae, then pupae, and then they become adult mosquitos. The males live for about a week to ten days, and the females can live up to several weeks. Some female mosquitoes can hibernate in the winter, and they can live for months.\\nWhat health problems can mosquito bites cause?\\nMost mosquito bites are harmless, but there are times when they can be dangerous. The ways that mosquito bites can affect humans include:\\nCausing itchy bumps, as an immune system response to the mosquito's saliva. This is the most common reaction. The bumps usually go away after a day or two.\\nCausing allergic reactions, including blisters, large hives, and in rare cases, anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis is a severe allergic reaction that affects the whole body. It is a medical emergency.\\nSpreading diseases to humans. Some of these diseases can be serious. Many of them do not have any treatments, and only a few have vaccines to prevent them. These diseases are more of a problem in Africa and other tropical areas of the world, but more of them are spreading to the United States. One factor is climate change, which makes the conditions in some parts of the United States more favorable to certain types of mosquitoes. Other reasons include increased trade with, and travel to, tropical and subtropical areas.\\n\\nWhich diseases can mosquitoes spread?\\nCommon diseases spread by mosquitoes include:\\nChikungunya, a viral infection that causes symptoms such as fever and severe joint pain. The symptoms usually last about a week, but for some, the joint pain may last for months. Most cases of chikungunya in the United States are in people who traveled to other countries. There have been a few cases where it has spread in the United States.\\nDengue, a viral infection that causes a high fever, headaches, joint and muscle pain, vomiting, and a rash. Most people get better within a few weeks. In some cases, it can become very severe, even life-threatening. Dengue is rare in the United States.\\nMalaria, a parasitic disease that causes serious symptoms such as high fevers, shaking chills, and flu-like illness. It can be life-threatening, but there are drugs to treat it. Malaria is a major health problem in many tropical and subtropical areas of the world. Almost all cases of malaria in the United States are in people who traveled to other countries.\\nWest Nile Virus (WNV), a viral infection that often has no symptoms. In those that do have symptoms, they are usually mild, and include fever, headache, and nausea. In rare cases, the virus can enter the brain, and it can be life-threatening. WNV has spread across the continental United States.\\nZika Virus, a viral infection that often does not cause symptoms. One in five infected people do get symptoms, which are usually mild. They include a fever, rash, joint pain, and pink eye. Besides being spread by mosquitoes, Zika can spread from mother to baby during pregnancy and cause serious birth defects. It can also spread from one partner to another during sex. There have been a few outbreaks of Zika in the southern United States.\\n\\nCan mosquito bites be prevented?\\n\\nUse an insect repellent when you go outdoors. Choose an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-registered insect repellent. They are evaluated to make sure they are safe and effective. Make sure that the repellant has one of these ingredients: DEET, picaridin, IR3535, oil of lemon eucalyptus, or para-menthane-diol. It is important to follow the instructions on the label.\\nCover up. Wear long sleeves, long pants, and socks when outdoors. Mosquitoes may bite through thin fabric, so spray thin clothes with an EPA-registered repellent like permethrin. Don't apply permethrin directly to skin.\\nMosquito-proof your home.

       " 'Staphylococcal Infections': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nWhat are Staphylococcal (staph) infections?\\nStaphylococcus (staph) is a group of bacteria. There are more than 30 types. A type called Staphylococcus aureus causes most infections.\\nStaph bacteria can cause many different types of infections, including:\\nSkin infections, which are the most common types of staph infections\\nBacteremia, an infection of the bloodstream. This can lead to sepsis, a very serious immune response to infection.\\nBone infections\\nEndocarditis, an infection of the inner lining of the heart chambers and valves\\nFood poisoning\\nPneumonia\\nToxic shock syndrome (TSS), a life-threatening condition caused by toxins from certain types of bacteria\\n\\nWhat causes staph infections?\\nSome people carry staph bacteria on their skin or in their noses, but they do not get an infection. But if they get a cut or wound, the bacteria can enter the body and cause an infection.\\nStaph bacteria can spread from person to person. They can also spread on objects, such as towels, clothing, door handles, athletic equipment, and remotes. If you have staph and do not handle food properly when you are preparing it, you can also spread staph to others.\\nWho is at risk for staph infections?\\nAnyone can develop a staph infection, but certain people are at greater risk, including those who:\\nHave a chronic condition such as diabetes, cancer, vascular disease, eczema, and lung disease\\nHave a weakened immune system, such as from HIV/AIDS, medicines to prevent organ rejection, or chemotherapy\\nHad surgery\\nUse a catheter, breathing tube, or feeding tube\\nAre on dialysis\\nInject illegal drugs\\nDo contact sports, since you may have skin-to-skin contact with others or share equipment\\n\\nWhat are the symptoms of staph infections?\\nThe symptoms of a staph infection depend on the type of infection:\\nSkin infections can look like pimples or boils. They may be red, swollen, and painful. Sometimes there is pus or other drainage. They can turn into impetigo, which turns into a crust on the skin, or cellulitis, a swollen, red area of skin that feels hot.\\nBone infections can cause pain, swelling, warmth, and redness in the infected area. You may also have chills and a fever.\\nEndocarditis causes some flu-like symptoms: fever, chills, and fatigue. It also causes symptoms such as rapid heartbeat, shortness of breath, and fluid buildup in your arms or legs.\\nFood poisoning typically causes nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, and a fever. If you lose too many fluids, you may also become dehydrated. \\nPneumonia symptoms include a high fever, chills, and cough that doesn't get better. You may also have chest pain and shortness of breath.\\nToxic shock syndrome (TSS) causes high fever, sudden low blood pressure, vomiting, diarrhea, and confusion. You may have a sunburn-like rash somewhere on your body. TSS can lead to organ failure.\\n\\nHow are staph infections diagnosed?\\nYour health care provider will do a physical exam and ask about your symptoms. Often, providers can tell if you have a staph skin infection by looking at it. To check for other types of staph infections, providers may do a culture, with a skin scraping, tissue sample, stool sample, or throat or nasal swabs. There may be other tests, such as imaging tests, depending on the type of infection.\\nWhat are the treatments for staph infections?\\nTreatment for staph infections is antibiotics. Depending on the type of infection, you may get a cream, ointment, medicines (to swallow), or intravenous (IV). If you have an infected wound, your provider might drain it. Sometimes you may need surgery for bone infections.\\nSome staph infections, such as MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus), are resistant to many antibiotics. There are still certain antibiotics that can treat these infections.\\nCan staph infections be prevented?\\nCertain steps can help to prevent staph infections:\\nUse good hygiene, including washing your hands often\\nDon't share towels, sheets, or clothing with someone who has a staph infection\\nIt's best not to share athletic equipment.

There may be a specific cause, such as Legionnaire's disease. Sometimes the cause of the illness cannot be found. This is known as sick building syndrome.\\nUsually indoor air quality problems only cause discomfort. Most people feel better as soon as they remove the source of the pollution.  However, some pollutants can cause diseases that show up much later, such as respiratory diseases or cancer.\\nMaking sure that your building is well-ventilated and getting rid of pollutants can improve the quality of your indoor air.\\nEnvironmental Protection Agency\\n\",\n",
       " 'Pinworms': '\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nPinworms are small parasites that can live in the colon and rectum.   You get them when you swallow their eggs. The eggs hatch inside your intestines. While you sleep, the female pinworms leave the intestines through the anus and  lay eggs on nearby skin.\\nPinworms spread easily. When people who are infected touch their anus, the eggs attach to their fingertips.  They can spread the eggs to others directly through their hands, or through contaminated clothing, bedding, food, or other articles. The eggs can live on household surfaces for up to 2 weeks.\\nThe infection is more common in children. Many people have no symptoms at all. Some people feel itching around the anus or vagina. The itching may become intense, interfere with sleep, and make you irritable.\\nYour health care provider can diagnose pinworm infection by finding the eggs. A common way to collect the eggs is with a sticky piece of clear tape. Mild infections may not need treatment.  If you do need medicine, everyone in the household should take it. \\nTo prevent becoming infected or reinfected with pinworms,:\\nBathe after waking up\\nWash your pajamas and bed sheets often\\nWash your hands regularly, especially after using the bathroom or changing diapers\\nChange your underwear every day\\nAvoid nail biting\\nAvoid scratching the anal area\\n\\n\\n',\n",

       " 'Opioid Misuse and Addiction': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nOpioids, sometimes called narcotics, are a type of drug. They include strong prescription pain relievers, such as oxycodone, hydrocodone, fentanyl, and tramadol. The illegal drug heroin is also an opioid. Some opioids are made from the opium plant, and others are synthetic (man-made).\\nA doctor may give you a prescription opioid to reduce pain after you have had a major injury or surgery. You may get them if you have severe pain from health conditions like cancer.  Some doctors prescribe them for chronic pain.\\nOpioids can cause side effects such as drowsiness, mental fog, nausea, and constipation. They may also cause slowed breathing, which can lead to overdose deaths. If someone has signs of an overdose, call 911:\\n\\nThe person's face is extremely pale and/or feels clammy to the touch\\nTheir body goes limp\\nTheir fingernails or lips have a purple or blue color\\nThey start vomiting or making gurgling noises\\nThey cannot be awakened or are unable to speak\\nTheir breathing or heartbeat slows or stops\\n\\nOther risks of using prescription opioids include dependence and addiction. Dependence means feeling withdrawal symptoms when not taking the drug. Addiction is a chronic brain disease that causes a person to compulsively seek out drugs, even though they cause harm. The risks of dependence and addiction are higher if you misuse the medicines. Misuse can include taking too much medicine, taking someone else's medicine, taking it in a different way than you are supposed to, or taking the medicine to get high.\\nOpioid misuse, addiction, and overdoses are serious public health problems in the United States.  Another problem is that more women are misusing opioids during pregnancy. This can lead to babies being addicted and going through withdrawal, known as neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS). Opioid misuse may sometimes also lead to heroin use, because some people switch from prescription opioids to heroin.\\nThe main treatment for prescription opioid addiction is medication-assisted treatment (MAT). It includes medicines, counseling, and support from family and friends. MAT can help you stop using the drug, get through withdrawal, and cope with cravings. There is also a medicine called naloxone which can reverse the effects of an opioid overdose and prevent death, if it is given in time.\\nTo prevent problems with prescription opioids, be sure to follow your doctor's instructions when taking them. Do not share your medicines with anyone else. Contact your doctor if you have any concerns about taking the medicines.\\nNIH: National Institute on Drug Abuse\\n\",\n",

       " 'Lyme Disease': '\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nWhat is Lyme disease?\\nLyme disease is a bacterial infection you get from the bite of an infected tick. At first, Lyme disease usually causes symptoms such as a rash, fever, headache, and fatigue.  But if it is not treated early, the infection can spread to your joints, heart, and nervous system. Prompt treatment can help you recover quickly.\\nWhat causes Lyme disease?\\nLyme disease is caused by bacteria. In the United States, this is usually a bacterium called Borrelia burgdorferi. It spreads to humans through the bite of an infected tick. The ticks that spread it are blacklegged ticks (or deer ticks). They are usually found in the:\\nNortheast\\nMid-Atlantic\\nUpper Midwest\\nPacific coast, especially northern California\\n\\nThese ticks can attach to any part your body. But they are often found in hard-to-see areas such as your groin, armpits, and scalp. Usually the tick must be attached to you for 36 to 48 hours or more to spread the bacterium to you.\\nWho is at risk for Lyme disease?\\nAnyone can get a tick bite. But people who spend lots of time outdoors in wooded, grassy areas are at a higher risk. This includes campers, hikers, and people who work in gardens and parks.\\nMost tick bites happen in the summer months when ticks are most active and people spend more time outdoors. But you can get bitten in the warmer months of early fall, or even late winter if temperatures are unusually high. And if there is a mild winter, ticks may come out earlier than usual.\\nWhat are the symptoms of Lyme disease?\\nEarly symptoms of Lyme disease start between 3 to 30 days after an infected tick bites you. The symptoms can include:\\nA red rash called erythema migrans (EM). Most people with Lyme disease get this rash. It gets bigger over several days and may feel warm. It is usually not painful or itchy. As it starts to get better, parts of it may fade. Sometimes this makes the rash look like a \"bull\\'s-eye.\"\\nFever\\nChills\\nHeadache\\nFatigue\\nMuscle and joint aches\\nSwollen lymph nodes\\n\\nIf the infection is not treated, it can spread to your joints, heart, and nervous system.

These antibodies can take several weeks to develop. If you are tested right away, it may not show that you have Lyme disease, even if you have it. So you may need to have another test later.\\nWhat are the treatments for Lyme disease?\\nLyme disease is treated with antibiotics. The earlier you are treated, the better; it gives you the best chance of fully recovering quickly.\\nAfter treatment, some patients may still have pain, fatigue, or difficulty thinking that lasts more than 6 months. This is called post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome (PTLDS). Researchers don\\'t know why some people have PTLDS. There is no proven treatment for PTLDS; long-term antibiotics have not been shown to help. However, there are ways to help with the symptoms of PTLDS. If you have been treated for Lyme disease and still feel unwell, contact your health care provider about how to manage your symptoms. Most people do get better with time. But it can take several months before you feel all better.\\nCan Lyme disease be prevented?\\nTo prevent Lyme disease, you should lower your risk of getting a tick bite:\\nAvoid areas where ticks live, such as grassy, brushy, or wooded areas. If you are hiking, walk in the center of the trail to avoid brush and grass.\\nUse an insect repellent with DEET\\nTreat your clothing and gear with a repellant containing 0.5% permethrin\\nWear light-colored protective clothing, so you can easily see any ticks that get on you\\nWear a long-sleeve shirt and long pants.

The rotator cuff keeps your shoulder stable when you move your arm in any direction.\\nWhat are rotator cuff injuries?\\nRotator cuff injuries are common. Most of them are wear-and-tear injuries from doing the same arm movements over and over - especially reaching over your head. With time, the tissues in the rotator cuff break down, leading to these injuries:\\n\\nTendinitis. The tendons in the rotator cuff connect your muscles to your shoulder bones. In tendinitis, the tendons become irritated and swollen from being pinched during shoulder movements.\\nBursitis. The bursa is a small, fluid-filled sac that pads the space between the rotator cuff and the bones of your shoulder. Bursitis happens when the muscle and bone rub the bursa too much. It swells with extra fluid, which causes pain\\nRotator cuff tears.

       " 'Chronic Bronchitis': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nWhat is chronic bronchitis?\\nChronic bronchitis is a type of COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). COPD is a group of lung diseases that make it hard to breathe and get worse over time. The other main type of COPD is emphysema. Most people with COPD have both emphysema and chronic bronchitis, but how severe each type is can be different from person to person.\\nChronic bronchitis is inflammation (swelling) and irritation of the bronchial tubes. These tubes are the airways that carry air to and from the air sacs in your lungs. The irritation of the tubes causes mucus to build up. This mucus and the swelling of the tubes make it harder for your lungs to move oxygen in and carbon dioxide out of your body.\\nWhat causes chronic bronchitis?\\nThe cause of chronic bronchitis is usually long-term exposure to irritants that damage your lungs and airways. In the United States, cigarette smoke is the main cause. Pipe, cigar, and other types of tobacco smoke can also cause chronic bronchitis, especially if you inhale them.\\nExposure to other inhaled irritants can contribute to chronic bronchitis. These include secondhand smoke, air pollution, and chemical fumes or dusts from the environment or workplace.\\nRarely, a genetic condition called alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency can play a role in causing chronic bronchitis.\\nWho is at risk for chronic bronchitis?\\nThe risk factors for chronic bronchitis include:\\nSmoking. This the main risk factor. Up to 75% of people who have chronic bronchitis smoke or used to smoke.\\nLong-term exposure to other lung irritants, such as secondhand smoke, air pollution, and chemical fumes and dusts from the environment or workplace.\\nAge. Most people who have chronic bronchitis are at least 40 years old when their symptoms begin.\\nGenetics. This includes alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, which is a genetic condition. Also, smokers who get chronic bronchitis are more likely to get it if they have a family history of COPD.\\n\\nWhat are the symptoms of chronic bronchitis?\\nAt first, you may have no symptoms or only mild symptoms. As the disease gets worse, your symptoms usually become more severe. They can include:\\nFrequent coughing or a cough that produces a lot mucus\\nWheezing\\nA whistling or squeaky sound when you breathe\\nShortness of breath, especially with physical activity\\nTightness in your chest\\n\\nSome people with chronic bronchitis get frequent respiratory infections such as colds and the flu. In severe cases, chronic bronchitis can cause weight loss, weakness in your lower muscles, and swelling in your ankles, feet, or legs.\\nHow is chronic bronchitis diagnosed?\\nYour health care provider may use many tools to make a diagnosis:\\nA medical history, which includes asking about your symptoms\\nA family history\\nVarious tests, such as lung function tests, a chest x-ray or CT scan, and blood tests\\n\\nWhat are the treatments for chronic bronchitis?\\nThere is no cure for chronic bronchitis. However, treatments can help with symptoms, slow the progress of the disease, and improve your ability to stay active. There are also treatments to prevent or treat complications of the disease. Treatments include:\\nLifestyle changes, such as\\n\\t\\nQuitting smoking if you are a smoker. This is the most important step you can take to treat chronic bronchitis.\\nAvoiding secondhand smoke and places where you might breathe in other lung irritants\\nAsk your health care provider for an eating plan that will meet your nutritional needs. Also ask about how much physical activity you can do. Physical activity can strengthen the muscles that help you breathe and improve your overall wellness.\\n\\n\\nMedicines, such as\\n\\t\\nBronchodilators, which relax the muscles around your airways. This helps open your airways and makes breathing easier. Most bronchodilators are taken through an inhaler. In more severe cases, the inhaler may also contain steroids to reduce inflammation.\\nVaccines for the flu and pneumococcal pneumonia, since people with chronic bronchitis are at higher risk for serious problems from these diseases.\\nAntibiotics if you get a bacterial or viral lung infection\\n\\n\\nOxygen therapy, if you have severe chronic bronchitis and low levels of oxygen in your blood. Oxygen therapy can help you breathe better. You may need extra oxygen all the time or only at certain times.\\nPulmonary rehabilitation, which is a program that helps improve the well-being of people who have chronic breathing problems. It may include\\n\\nAn exercise program\\nDisease management training\\nNutritional counseling\\nPsychological counseling\\n\\nA lung transplant, as a last resort for people who have severe symptoms that have not gotten better with medicines\\n\\nIf you have chronic bronchitis, it's important to know when and where to get help for your symptoms. You should get emergency care if you have severe symptoms, such as trouble catching your breath or talking. Call your health care provider if your symptoms are getting worse or if you have signs of an infection, such as a fever.\\nCan chronic bronchitis be prevented?\\nSince smoking causes most cases of chronic bronchitis, the best way to prevent it is to not smoke. It's also important to try to avoid lung irritants such as secondhand smoke, air pollution, chemical fumes, and dusts.\\nNIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute\\n\",\n",
       " 'Dietary Proteins': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nProtein is in every cell in the body. Our bodies need protein from the foods we eat to build and maintain bones, muscles and skin. We get proteins in our diet from meat, dairy products, nuts, and certain grains and beans. Proteins from meat and other animal products are complete proteins. This means they supply all of the amino acids the body can't make on its own. Most plant proteins are incomplete. You should eat different types of plant proteins every day to get all of the amino acids your body needs.\\nIt is important to get enough dietary protein. You need to eat protein every day, because your body doesn't store it the way it stores fats or carbohydrates.  How much you need depends on your age, sex, health, and level of physical activity. Most Americans eat enough protein in their diet.\\n\",\n",

       " 'High Blood Pressure': '\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nWhat is blood pressure?\\nBlood pressure is the force of your blood pushing against the walls of your arteries. Each time your heart beats, it pumps blood into the arteries. Your blood pressure is highest when your heart beats, pumping the blood. This is called systolic pressure. When your heart is at rest, between beats, your blood pressure falls. This is called diastolic pressure.\\nYour blood pressure reading uses these two numbers. Usually the systolic number comes before or above the diastolic number. For example, 120/80 means a systolic of 120 and a diastolic of 80.\\nHow is high blood pressure diagnosed?\\nHigh blood pressure usually has no symptoms. So the only way to find out if you have it is to get regular blood pressure checks from your health care provider. Your provider will use a gauge, a stethoscope or electronic sensor, and a blood pressure cuff. He or she will take two or more readings at separate appointments before making a diagnosis.\\n\\n\\n\\nBlood Pressure Category\\nSystolic Blood Pressure\\n\\nDiastolic Blood Pressure\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNormal\\nLess than 120\\nand\\nLess than 80\\n\\n\\nHigh Blood Pressure (no other heart risk factors)\\n140 or higher\\nor\\n90 or higher\\n\\n\\nHigh Blood Pressure (with other heart risk factors, according to some providers)\\n130 or higher\\nor\\n80 or higher\\n\\n\\nDangerously high blood pressure - seek medical care right away\\n180 or higher\\nand\\n120 or higher\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFor children and teens, the health care provider compares the blood pressure reading to what is normal for other kids who are the same age, height, and sex.\\nWhat are the different types of high blood pressure?\\nThere are two main types of high blood pressure: primary and secondary high blood pressure.:\\nPrimary, or essential, high blood pressure is the most common type of high blood pressure. For most people who get this kind of blood pressure, it develops over time as you get older.\\nSecondary high blood pressure is caused by another medical condition or use of certain medicines. It usually gets better after you treat that condition or stop taking the medicines that are causing it.\\n\\nWhy do I need to worry about high blood pressure?\\nWhen your blood pressure stays high over time, it causes the heart to pump harder and work overtime, possibly leading to serious health problems such as heart attack, stroke, heart failure, and kidney failure.\\nWhat are the treatments for high blood pressure?\\nTreatments for high blood pressure include heart-healthy lifestyle changes and medicines.\\nYou will work with your provider to come up with a treatment plan. It may include only the lifestyle changes. These changes, such as heart-healthy eating and exercise, can be very effective. But sometimes the changes do not control or lower your high blood pressure. Then you may need to take medicine. There are different types of blood pressure medicines.

       " 'HIV/AIDS in Women': '\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nWhat are HIV and AIDS?\\nHIV stands for human immunodeficiency virus. It harms your immune system by destroying the white blood cells that fight infection.  AIDS stands for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. It is the final stage of infection with HIV. Not everyone with HIV develops AIDS.\\nHow does HIV spread?\\nHIV can spread in different ways:\\nThrough unprotected sex with a person who has HIV. This is the most common way it spreads. Women may be at greater risk of being infected with HIV during sexual contact than men are. For example, vaginal tissue is fragile and can tear during sex. This can let HIV enter the body. Also, the vagina has a large surface area that can be exposed to the virus.\\nBy sharing drug needles\\nThrough contact with the blood of a person who has HIV\\nFrom mother to baby during pregnancy, childbirth, or breastfeeding\\n\\nHow does HIV/AIDS affect women differently from men?\\nAbout one in four people in the United States who have HIV are women. Women who have HIV/AIDS have some different problems from men:\\nComplications such as \\n  \\nRepeated vaginal yeast infections\\nSevere pelvic inflammatory disease (PID)\\n A higher risk of cervical cancer\\nMenstrual cycle problems\\nA higher risk of osteoporosis\\nEntering menopause younger or having more severe hot flashes\\n\\nDifferent, sometimes more severe, side effects from the medicines that treat HIV/AIDS\\nDrug interactions between some HIV/AIDS medicines and hormonal birth control\\nThe risk of giving HIV to their baby while pregnant or during childbirth\\n\\nAre there treatments for HIV/AIDS?\\nThere is no cure, but there are many medicines to treat both HIV infection and the infections and cancers that come with it.

       " 'Diarrhea': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nWhat is diarrhea?\\nDiarrhea is loose, watery stools (bowel movements). You have diarrhea if you have loose stools three or more times in one day. Acute diarrhea is diarrhea that lasts a short time. It is a common problem.  It usually lasts about one or two days, but it may last longer. Then it goes away on its own.\\nDiarrhea lasting more than a few days may be a sign of a more serious problem. Chronic diarrhea -- diarrhea that lasts at least four weeks -- can be a symptom of a chronic disease. Chronic diarrhea symptoms may be continual, or they may come and go.\\nWhat causes diarrhea?\\nThe most common causes of diarrhea include:\\nBacteria from contaminated food or water\\nViruses such as the flu, norovirus, or rotavirus . Rotavirus is the most common cause of acute diarrhea in children.\\nParasites, which are tiny organisms found in contaminated food or water\\nMedicines such as antibiotics, cancer drugs, and antacids that contain magnesium\\nFood intolerances and sensitivities, which are problems digesting certain ingredients or foods. An example is lactose intolerance.\\nDiseases that affect the stomach, small intestine, or colon, such as Crohn's disease\\nProblems with how the colon functions, such as irritable bowel syndrome\\n\\nSome people also get diarrhea after stomach surgery, because sometimes the surgeries can cause food to move through your digestive system more quickly.\\nSometimes no cause can be found. If your diarrhea goes away within a few days, finding the cause is usually not necessary.\\nWho is at risk for diarrhea?\\nPeople of all ages can get diarrhea. On average, adults In the United States have acute diarrhea once a year. Young children have it an average of twice a year.\\nPeople who visit developing countries are at risk for traveler's diarrhea. It is caused by consuming contaminated food or water.\\nWhat other symptoms might I have with diarrhea?\\nOther possible symptoms of diarrhea include:\\nCramps or pain in the abdomen\\nAn urgent need to use the bathroom\\nLoss of bowel control\\n\\nIf a virus or bacteria is the cause of your diarrhea, you may also have a fever, chills, and bloody stools.\\nDiarrhea can cause dehydration, which means that your body does not have enough fluid to work properly. Dehydration can be serious, especially for children, older adults, and people with weakened immune systems.\\nWhen do I need to see a health care provider for diarrhea?\\nAlthough it is usually not harmful, diarrhea can become dangerous or signal a more serious problem. Contact your health care provider if you have:\\nSigns of dehydration\\nDiarrhea for more than 2 days, if you are an adult. For children, contact the provider if it lasts more than 24 hours.\\nSevere pain in your abdomen or rectum (for adults)\\nA fever of 102 degrees or higher\\nStools containing blood or pus\\nStools that are black and tarry\\n\\nIf children have diarrhea, parents or caregivers should not hesitate to call a health care provider. Diarrhea can be especially dangerous in newborns and infants.\\nHow is the cause of diarrhea diagnosed?\\nTo find the cause of diarrhea, your health care provider may:\\nDo a physical exam\\nAsk about any medicines you are taking\\nTest your stool or blood to look for bacteria, parasites, or other signs of disease or infection\\nAsk you to stop eating certain foods to see whether your diarrhea goes away\\n\\nIf you have chronic diarrhea, your health care provider may perform other tests to look for signs of disease.\\nWhat are the treatments for diarrhea?\\nDiarrhea is treated by replacing lost fluids and electrolytes to prevent dehydration. Depending on the cause of the problem, you may need medicines to stop the diarrhea or treat an infection.\\nAdults with diarrhea should drink water, fruit juices, sports drinks, sodas without caffeine, and salty broths. As your symptoms improve, you can eat soft, bland food.\\nChildren with diarrhea should be given oral rehydration solutions to replace lost fluids and electrolytes.\\nCan diarrhea be prevented?\\nTwo types of diarrhea can be prevented - rotavirus diarrhea and traveler's diarrhea. There are vaccines for rotavirus. They are given to babies in two or three doses.\\nYou can help prevent traveler's diarrhea by being careful about what you eat and drink when you are in developing countries:\\nUse only bottled or purified water for drinking, making ice cubes, and brushing your teeth\\nIf you do use tap water, boil it or use iodine tablets\\nMake sure that the cooked food you eat is fully cooked and served hot\\nAvoid unwashed or unpeeled raw fruits and vegetables\\n\\nNIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases\\n\",\n",
       " 'Premature Babies': '\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nAlmost 1 of every 10 infants born in the United States are premature, or preemies. A premature birth is when a baby is born before 37 completed weeks of pregnancy. A full-term pregnancy is 40 weeks.\\nImportant growth and development happen throughout pregnancy - especially in the final months and weeks. Because they are born too early, preemies weigh much less than full-term babies. They may have health problems because their organs did not have enough time to develop. Problems that a baby born too early may have include:\\nBreathing problems\\nFeeding difficulties\\nCerebral palsy\\nDevelopmental delay\\nVision problems\\nHearing problems\\n\\nPreemies need special medical care in a neonatal intensive care unit, or NICU.  They stay there until their organ systems can work on their own. \\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention\\n',\n",
       " 'Tanning': '\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nCan a tan be healthy?\\nSome people think that tanning gives them a healthy glow. But tanning, either outdoors or indoors with a tanning bed, is not healthy at all. It exposes you to harmful rays and puts you at risk for health problems such as melanoma and other skin cancers.\\nWhat are UV rays, and how do they affect the skin?\\nSunlight travels to earth as a mixture of both visible and invisible rays. Some of the rays are harmless to people. But one kind, ultraviolet (UV) rays, can cause problems. They are a form of radiation. UV rays do help your body make vitamin D, but too much exposure damages your skin. Most people can get the vitamin D that they need with only about 5 to 15 minutes of sun exposure two to three times a week.\\nThere are three types of UV rays. Two of them, UVA and UVB, can reach the earth\\'s surface and affect your skin. Using a tanning bed also exposes you to UVA and UVB.\\nUVB rays can cause sunburn. UVA rays can travel more deeply into the skin than UVB rays. When your skin is exposed to UVA, it tries to protect itself from further damage. It does this by making more melanin, which is the skin pigment that makes your skin darker. That\\'s what gives you a tan. This means that your tan is a sign of skin damage.\\nWhat are the health risks of tanning?\\nSince tanning means overexposure to UV rays, it can damage your skin and cause health problems such as:\\nPremature skin aging, which can cause your skin to become thickened, leathery, and wrinkled. You may also have dark spots on your skin. These happen because long-term exposure to UV rays makes your skin less elastic. The more sun exposure you have, the earlier your skin ages.\\nSkin cancers, including melanoma. This can happen because the UV light damages the DNA of your skin cells and interferes with your body\\'s ability to fight the cancer.\\nActinic keratosis, a thick, scaly patch of skin that usually forms on areas exposed to the sun, such as the face, scalp, back of the hands, or chest. It can eventually become cancerous.\\nEye damage, including cataracts and photokeratitis (snow blindness)\\nA weakened immune system, which can increase your sensitivity to sunlight, decrease the effects of vaccines, and cause you to have reactions to certain medicines.\\n\\nWhat should I do to protect my skin from UV rays?\\n\\nLimit sun exposure. Try to stay out of the sun between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m., when its rays are strongest. But remember that you still get sun exposure when you are outside on cloudy days or are in the shade.\\nUse sunscreen with sun protective factor (SPF) 15 or higher. It should also be a broad-spectrum sunscreen, which means that it gives you both UVA and UVB protection. If you have very light skin, use SPF 30 or higher. Apply sunscreen 20-30 minutes before going outside and reapply it at least every 2 hours.\\nWear sunglasses that block both UVA and UVB rays. Wrap-around sunglasses work best because they block UV rays from sneaking in from the side.\\nWear a hat. You can get the best protection with a wide-brimmed hat that is made out of a tightly woven fabric, such as canvas.\\nWear protective clothing such as long-sleeved shirts and long pants and skirts. Clothes made from tightly woven fabric offer the best protection.\\n\\nIt is also important to check your skin once a month. If you do see any new or changing spots or moles, go see your health care provider.\\nIsn\\'t indoor tanning safer than tanning in the sun?\\nIndoor tanning is not better than tanning in the sun; it also exposes you to UV rays and damages your skin. Tanning beds use UVA light, so they expose you to a higher concentration of UVA rays than you would get by tanning in the sun. Tanning lights also expose you to some UVB rays.\\nSome people think that getting a \"base tan\" in a tanning salon can protect you when you go in the sun. But a \"base tan\" causes damage to your skin and will not prevent you from getting sunburn when you go outside.\\nIndoor tanning is particularly dangerous for younger people. You have a higher risk of melanoma if you started doing indoor tanning while you were a teen or young adult.\\nSome research shows that frequent tanning may even be addictive. This can be dangerous because the more often you tan, the more damage you do to your skin.\\nAre there safer ways to look tan?\\nThere are other ways to look tan, but they are not all safe:\\nTanning pills have a color additive that turns your skin orange after you take them. But they can be dangerous and are not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\\nSunless tanners have no known risk for skin cancer, but you do have to be careful. Most spray tans, lotions, and gels use DHA, a color additive that makes your skin look tan. DHA is considered safe for use on the outside of your body by the FDA. You need to make sure it doesn\\'t get into your nose, eyes, or mouth. If you use a spray tan, be careful not to breathe in the spray. Also, remember that these \"tans\" do not protect you from UV rays when you go outside.\\n\\n',\n",
       " 'Pneumococcal Infections': '\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nPneumococci are a type of streptococcus bacteria. The bacteria spread through contact with people who are ill or by healthy people who carry the bacteria in the back of their nose. Pneumococcal infections can be mild or severe. The most common types of infections are:\\nEar infections\\nSinus infections\\nPneumonia\\nSepsis\\nMeningitis\\n\\nHow the diagnosis is made depends upon where the infection is. Your doctor will do a physical exam and ask about your medical history.  Possible tests may include blood, imaging, or lab tests. Treatment is with antibiotics. Vaccines can prevent pneumococcal infections. There are two vaccines. One is for infants and young children.

You may need to take medicine every day, or you may only need to take medicine once in a while.  Either way, you want to make sure that your medicines are safe, and that they will help you get better. In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration is in charge of ensuring that your prescription and over-the-counter medicines are safe and effective.\\nThere are always risks to taking medicines. It is important to think about these risks before you take a medicine. Even safe medicines can cause unwanted side effects or interactions with food, alcohol, or other medicines you may be taking. Some medicines may not be safe during pregnancy. To reduce the risk of reactions and make sure that you get better, it is important for you to take your medicines correctly. You should also be careful when giving medicines to children, since they can be more vulnerable to the effects of medicines.\\n',\n",

       " 'Hepatitis': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nWhat is hepatitis?\\nHepatitis is inflammation of the liver. Inflammation is swelling that happens when tissues of the body are injured or infected. It can damage your liver. This swelling and damage can affect how well your liver functions.\\nHepatitis can be an acute (short-term) infection or a chronic (long-term) infection. Some types of hepatitis cause only acute infections. Other types can cause both acute and chronic infections.\\nWhat causes hepatitis?\\nThere are different types of hepatitis, with different causes:\\nViral hepatitis is the most common type. It is caused by one of several viruses -- hepatitis viruses A, B, C, D, and E. In the United States, A, B, and C are the most common.\\nAlcoholic hepatitis is caused by heavy alcohol use\\nToxic hepatitis can be caused by certain poisons, chemicals, medicines, or supplements\\nAutoimmune hepatitis is a chronic type in which your body's immune system attacks your liver. The cause is not known, but genetics and your environment may play a role.\\n\\nHow is viral hepatitis spread?\\nHepatitis A and hepatitis E usually spread through contact with food or water that was contaminated with an infected person's stool. You can also get hepatitis E by eating undercooked pork, deer, or shellfish.\\nHepatitis B, hepatitis C, and hepatitis D spread through contact with the blood of someone who has the disease. Hepatitis B and D may also spread through contact with other body fluids. This can happen in many ways, such as sharing drug needles or having unprotected sex.\\nWho is at risk for hepatitis?\\nThe risks are different for the different types of hepatitis. For example, with most of the viral types, your risk is higher if you have unprotected sex.  People who drink a lot over long periods of time are at risk for alcoholic hepatitis.\\nWhat are the symptoms of hepatitis?\\nSome people with hepatitis do not have symptoms and do not know they are infected. If you do have symptoms, they may include:\\nFever\\nFatigue\\nLoss of appetite\\nNausea and/or vomiting\\nAbdominal pain\\nDark urine\\nClay-colored bowel movements\\nJoint pain\\nJaundice, yellowing of your skin and eyes\\n\\nIf you have an acute infection, your symptoms can start anywhere between 2 weeks to 6 months after you got infected. If you have a chronic infection, you may not have symptoms until many years later.\\nWhat other problems can hepatitis cause?\\nChronic hepatitis can lead to complications such as cirrhosis (scarring of the liver), liver failure, and liver cancer. Early diagnosis and treatment of chronic hepatitis may prevent these complications.\\nHow is hepatitis diagnosed?\\nTo diagnose hepatitis, your health care provider:\\nWill ask about your symptoms and medical history\\nWill do a physical exam\\nWill likely do blood tests, including tests for viral hepatitis\\nMight do imaging tests, such as an ultrasound, CT scan, or MRI\\nMay need to do a liver biopsy to get a clear diagnosis and check for liver damage\\n\\nWhat are the treatments for hepatitis?\\nTreatment for hepatitis depends on which type you have and whether it is acute or chronic. Acute viral hepatitis often goes away on its own. To feel better, you may just need to rest and get enough fluids. But in some cases, it may be more serious. You might even need treatment in a hospital.\\nThere are different medicines to treat the different chronic types of hepatitis. Possible other treatments may include surgery and other medical procedures. People who have alcoholic hepatitis need to stop drinking. If your chronic hepatitis leads to liver failure or liver cancer, you may need a liver transplant.\\nCan hepatitis be prevented?\\nThere are different ways to prevent or lower your risk for hepatitis, depending on the type of hepatitis. For example, not drinking too much alcohol can prevent alcoholic hepatitis. There are vaccines to prevent hepatitis A and B. Autoimmune hepatitis cannot be prevented.\\nNIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases\\n\",\n",
       " 'Meningococcal Infections': '\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nMeningococci are a type of bacteria that cause serious infections. The most common infection is meningitis, which is an inflammation of the thin tissue that surrounds the brain and spinal cord. Meningococci can also cause other problems, including a serious bloodstream infection called sepsis.\\nMeningococcal infections can spread from person to person. Risk factors include:\\nAge - it is more common in infants, teens, and young adults\\nLiving in close quarters, such as in college dorms or military settings\\nCertain medical conditions, such as not having a spleen\\nTravel to areas where meningococcal disease is common\\n\\nIn its early stages, you may have flu-like symptoms and a stiff neck. But the disease can progress quickly and can be fatal. Early diagnosis and treatment are extremely important. Lab tests on your blood and cerebrospinal fluid can tell if you have it. Treatment is with antibiotics. Since the infection spreads from person to person, family members may also need to be treated.\\nA vaccine can prevent meningococcal infections.\\n',\n",
       " 'Motion Sickness': '\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nMotion sickness is a common problem in people traveling by car, train, airplanes, and \\nespecially boats. Anyone can get it, but it is more common in children, pregnant women, and people taking certain medicines. Motion sickness can start suddenly, with a queasy feeling and cold sweats. It can then lead to dizziness and nausea and vomiting.\\nYour brain senses movement by getting signals from your inner ears, eyes, muscles, and joints. When it gets signals that do not match, you can get motion sickness. For example, if you are reading on your phone while riding a bus, your eyes are focused on something that is not moving, but your inner ear senses motion.\\nWhere you sit can make a difference. The front seat of a car, forward cars of a train, upper deck on a boat or wing seats in a plane may give you a smoother ride. Looking out into the distance - instead of trying to read or look at something in the vehicle - can also help. \\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention \\n',\n",
       " 'Water Pollution': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nWe all need clean water. People need it to grow crops and to operate factories, and for drinking and recreation.  Fish and wildlife depend on it to survive. \\nMany different pollutants can harm our rivers, streams, lakes, and oceans.  The three most common are soil, nutrients, and bacteria. Rain washes soil into streams and rivers. The soil can kill tiny animals and fish eggs. It can clog the gills of fish and block light, causing plants to die. Nutrients, often from fertilizers, cause problems in lakes, ponds, and reservoirs. Nitrogen and phosphorus make algae grow and can turn water green. Bacteria, often from sewage spills, can pollute fresh or salt water. \\nYou can help protect your water supply:\\n\\nDon't pour household products such as cleansers, beauty products, medicines, auto fluids, paint, and lawn care products down the drain. Take them to a hazardous waste collection site.\\nThrow away excess household grease (meat fats, lard, cooking oil, shortening, butter, margarine, etc.) diapers, condoms, and personal hygiene products in the garbage can.\\nClean up after your pets.

A weight-control strategy might include:\\nChoosing low-fat, low-calorie foods\\nEating smaller portions\\nDrinking water instead of sugary drinks\\nBeing physically active\\n\\nEating extra calories within a well-balanced diet can help to add weight.\\nNIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases\\n',\n",
       " 'Dentures': '\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nDentures are false teeth made to replace teeth you have lost. They can be complete or partial. Complete dentures cover your entire upper or lower jaw. Partials replace one or a few teeth.\\nDentures may feel strange at first. Speaking and eating may feel different. Be careful when wearing dentures because they may make it harder for you to feel hot foods and liquids. Also, you may not notice biting on a bone from your food.\\nIn the beginning, your dentist may want to see you often to make sure the dentures fit. Over time, your mouth will change and you may need to have your dentures adjusted or replaced. Be sure to let your dentist handle these adjustments.\\nIf your dentures move too much in your mouth, denture adhesive may help. In some cases, your dentist may suggest that you switch to dental implants. They are permanent, and they replace both the roots and teeth.\\nKeep your dentures clean and free from food that can cause stains, bad breath, or swollen gums. Brush them every day with a denture care product. Take your dentures out of your mouth at night, and put them in water or a denture-cleansing liquid.\\nNIH: National Institute on Aging\\n',\n",

       " 'Lupus': '\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nWhat is lupus?\\nLupus is an autoimmune disease. This means that your immune system attacks healthy cells and tissues by mistake. This can damage many parts of the body, including the joints, skin, kidneys, heart, lungs, blood vessels, and brain.\\nThere are several kinds of lupus:\\nSystemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is the most common type. It can be mild or severe and can affect many parts of the body.\\nDiscoid lupus causes a red rash that doesn\\'t go away\\nSubacute cutaneous lupus causes sores after being out in the sun\\nDrug-induced lupus is caused by certain medicines. It usually goes away when you stop taking the medicine.\\nNeonatal lupus, which is rare, affects newborns. It is probably caused by certain antibodies from the mother.\\n\\nWhat causes lupus?\\nThe cause of lupus is unknown.\\nWho is at risk for lupus?\\nAnyone can get lupus, but women are most at risk. Lupus is two to three times more common in African American women than in white women. It\\'s also more common in Hispanic, Asian, and Native American women. African American and Hispanic women are more likely to have severe forms of lupus.\\nWhat are the symptoms of lupus?\\nLupus can have many symptoms, and they differ from person to person. Some of the more common ones are:\\nPain or swelling in joints\\nMuscle pain\\nFever with no known cause\\nRed rashes, most often on the face (also called the \"butterfly rash\")\\nChest pain when taking a deep breath\\nHair loss\\nPale or purple fingers or toes\\nSensitivity to the sun\\nSwelling in legs or around eyes\\nMouth ulcers\\nSwollen glands\\nFeeling very tired\\n\\nSymptoms may come and go. When you are having symptoms, it is called a flare.  Flares can range from mild to severe. New symptoms may appear at any time.\\nHow is lupus diagnosed?\\nThere is no specific test for lupus, and it\\'s often mistaken for other diseases. So it may take months or years for a doctor to diagnose it. Your doctor may use many tools to make a diagnosis:\\nMedical history\\nComplete exam\\nBlood tests\\nSkin biopsy (looking at skin samples under a microscope)\\nKidney biopsy (looking at tissue from your kidney under a microscope)\\n\\nWhat are the treatments for lupus?\\nThere is no cure for lupus, but medicines and lifestyle changes can help control it.\\nPeople with lupus often need to see different doctors. You will have a primary care doctor and a rheumatologist (a doctor who specializes in the diseases of joints and muscles). Which other specialists you see depends on how lupus affects your body. For example, if lupus damages your heart or blood vessels, you would see a cardiologist.\\nYour primary care doctor should coordinate care between your different health care providers and treat other problems as they come up. Your doctor will develop a treatment plan to fit your needs. You and your doctor should review the plan often to be sure it is working. You should report new symptoms to your doctor right away so that your treatment plan can be changed if needed.\\nThe goals of the treatment plan are to:\\nPrevent flares\\nTreat flares when they occur\\nReduce organ damage and other problems\\n\\nTreatments may include drugs to:\\nReduce swelling and pain\\nPrevent or reduce flares\\nHelp the immune system\\nReduce or prevent damage to joints\\nBalance the hormones\\n\\nBesides taking medicines for lupus, you may need to take medicines for problems that are related to lupus such as high cholesterol, high blood pressure, or infection.\\nAlternative treatments are those that are not part of standard treatment. At this time, no research shows that alternative medicine can treat lupus. Some alternative or complementary approaches may help you cope or reduce some of the stress associated with living with a chronic illness. You should talk to your doctor before trying any alternative treatments.\\nHow can I cope with lupus?\\nIt is important to take an active role in your treatment. It helps to learn more about lupus - being able to spot the warning signs of a flare can help you prevent the flare or make the symptoms less severe.\\nIt is also important to find ways to cope with the stress of having lupus. Exercising and finding ways to relax may make it easier for you to cope. A good support system can also help.\\nNIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases\\n',\n",

You have one connecting the back of each eye (your retina) to your brain. Damage to an optic nerve can cause vision loss. The type of vision loss and how severe it is depends on where the damage occurs. It may affect one or both eyes.\\nThere are many different types of optic nerve disorders, including:\\n\\nGlaucoma is a group of diseases that are the leading cause of blindness in the United States. Glaucoma usually happens when the fluid pressure inside the eyes slowly rises and damages the optic nerve.\\nOptic neuritis is an inflammation of the optic nerve. Causes include infections and immune-related illnesses such as multiple sclerosis. Sometimes the cause is unknown.\\nOptic nerve atrophy is damage to the optic nerve. Causes include poor blood flow to the eye, disease, trauma, or exposure to toxic substances.\\nOptic nerve head drusen are pockets of protein and calcium salts that build up in the optic nerve over time\\n\\nContact your health care provider if you are having vision problems. Tests for optic nerve disorders may include eye exams, ophthalmoscopy (an examination of the back of your eye), and imaging tests. Treatment depends on which disorder that you have. With some optic nerve disorders, you may get your vision back. With others, there is no treatment, or treatment may only prevent further vision loss.\\n',\n",
       " 'Multiple Sclerosis': '\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nMultiple sclerosis (MS) is a nervous system disease that affects your brain and spinal cord.

This could be pills, capsules, or liquids.\\nTopically. This might be a cream, spray, or ointment that you put on your skin. It could also be eye ointment, eye drops, or ear drops.\\nThrough an injection or intravenously (IV). This is usually for more serious infections.\\n\\nWhat do antibiotics treat?\\nAntibiotics only treat certain bacterial infections, such as strep throat, urinary tract infections, and E. coli.\\nYou may not need to take antibiotics for some bacterial infections. For example, you might not need them for many sinus infections or some ear infections. Taking antibiotics when they're not needed won't help you, and they can have side effects. Your health care provider can decide the best treatment for you when you're sick. Don't ask your provider to prescribe an antibiotic for you.\\nDo antibiotics treat viral infections?\\nAntibiotics do not work on viral infections. For example, you shouldn't take antibiotics for:\\nColds and runny noses, even if the mucus is thick, yellow, or green\\nMost sore throats (except strep throat)\\nFlu\\nMost cases of bronchitis\\n\\nWhat are the side effects of antibiotics?\\nThe side effects of antibiotics range from minor to very severe.

Antibiotic resistance happens when the bacteria change and become able to resist the effects of an antibiotic. This means that the bacteria continue to grow.\\nHow do I use antibiotics correctly?\\nWhen you take antibiotics, it is important that you take them responsibly:\\nAlways follow the directions carefully. Finish your medicine even if you feel better. If you stop taking them too soon, some bacteria may survive and re-infect you.\\nDon't save your antibiotics for later.\\nDon't share your antibiotic with others.\\nDon't take antibiotics prescribed for someone else.

       " 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder': '\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nWhat is post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)?\\nPost-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a mental health disorder that some people develop after they experience or see a traumatic event. The traumatic event may be life-threatening, such as combat, a natural disaster, a car accident, or sexual assault. But sometimes the event is not necessarily a dangerous one. For example, the sudden, unexpected death of a loved one can also cause PTSD.\\nIt\\'s normal to feel afraid during and after a traumatic situation. The fear triggers a \"fight-or-flight\" response. This is your body\\'s way of helping to protect itself from possible harm. It causes changes in your body such as the release of certain hormones and increases in alertness, blood pressure, heart rate, and breathing.\\nIn time, most people recover from this naturally. But people with PTSD don\\'t feel better. They feel stressed and frightened long after the trauma is over. In some cases, the PTSD symptoms may start later on. They might also come and go over time.\\nWhat causes post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)?\\nResearchers don\\'t know why some people get PTSD and others don\\'t. Genetics, neurobiology, risk factors, and personal factors may affect whether you get PTSD after a traumatic event.\\nWho is at risk for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)?\\nYou can develop PTSD at any age. Many risk factors play a part in whether you will develop PTSD. They include:\\nYour sex; women are more likely to develop PTSD\\nHaving had trauma in childhood\\nFeeling horror, helplessness, or extreme fear\\nGoing through a traumatic event that lasts a long time\\nHaving little or no social support after the event\\nDealing with extra stress after the event, such as loss of a loved one, pain and injury, or loss of a job or home\\nHaving a history of mental illness or substance use\\n\\nWhat are the symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)?\\nThere are four types of PTSD symptoms, but they may not be the same for everyone. Each person experiences symptoms in their own way. The types are:\\nRe-experiencing symptoms, where something reminds you of the trauma and you feel that fear again. Examples include\\n\\t\\t\\nFlashbacks, which cause you to feel like you are going through the event again\\nNightmares\\nFrightening thoughts\\n\\n\\nAvoidance symptoms, where you try to avoid situations or people that trigger memories of the traumatic event. This may cause you to\\n\\t\\t\\nStay away from places, events, or objects that are reminders of the traumatic experience. For example, if you were in a car accident, you might stop driving.\\nAvoiding thoughts or feelings related to the traumatic event. For example, you might try to stay very busy to try to avoid thinking about what happened.\\n\\n\\nArousal and reactivity symptoms, which may cause you to be jittery or be on the lookout for danger. They include\\n\\t\\t\\nBeing easily startled\\nFeeling tense or \"on edge\"\\nHaving difficulty sleeping\\nHaving angry outbursts\\n\\n\\nCognition and mood symptoms, which are negative changes in beliefs and feelings. They include\\n\\t\\t\\nTrouble remembering important things about the traumatic event\\nNegative thoughts about yourself or the world\\nFeeling blame and guilt\\nNo longer being interested in things you enjoyed\\nTrouble concentrating\\n\\n\\n\\nThe symptoms usually start soon after the traumatic event. But sometimes they may not appear until months or years later. They also may come and go over many years.\\nIf your symptoms last longer than four weeks, cause you great distress, or interfere with your work or home life, you might have PTSD.\\nHow is post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) diagnosed?\\nA health care provider who has experience helping people with mental illnesses can diagnose PTSD. The provider will do a mental health screening and may also do a physical exam. To get a diagnosis of PTSD, you must have all of these symptoms for at least one month:\\nAt least one re-experiencing symptom\\nAt least one avoidance symptom\\nAt least two arousal and reactivity symptoms\\nAt least two cognition and mood symptoms\\n\\nWhat are the treatments for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)?\\nThe main treatments for PTSD are talk therapy, medicines, or both. PTSD affects people differently, so a treatment that works for one person may not work for another. If you have PTSD, you need to work with a mental health professional to find the best treatment for your symptoms.:\\nTalk therapy, or psychotherapy, which can teach you about your symptoms. You will learn how to identify what triggers them and how to manage them. There are different types of talk therapy for PTSD.\\nMedicines can help with the symptoms of PTSD. Antidepressants may help control symptoms such as sadness, worry, anger, and feeling numb inside. Other medicines can help with sleep problems and nightmares.\\n\\nCan post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) be prevented?\\nThere are certain factors that can help reduce the risk of developing PTSD. These are known as resilience factors, and they include:\\nSeeking out support from other people, such as friends, family, or a support group\\nLearning to feel good about your actions in the face of danger\\nHaving a coping strategy or a way of getting through the bad event and learning from it\\nBeing able to act and respond effectively despite feeling fear\\n\\nResearchers are studying the importance of the resilience and risk factors for PTSD.

Causes of male infertility include:\\nPhysical problems with the testicles\\nBlockages in the ducts that carry sperm\\nHormone problems\\nA history of high fevers or mumps\\nGenetic disorders\\nLifestyle or environmental factors\\n\\nAbout a third of the time, infertility is because of a problem with the man. One third of the time, it is a problem with the woman. Sometimes no cause can be found.\\nIf you suspect you are infertile, see your doctor. There are tests that may tell if you have fertility problems. When it is possible to find the cause, treatments may include medicines, surgery, or assisted reproductive technology. Happily, many couples treated for infertility are able to have babies.\\nNIH: National Institute of Child Health and Human Development\\n\",\n",
       " 'Heroin': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nHeroin is a white or brown powder or a black, sticky goo. It's  an opioid drug made from morphine, a natural substance in the seedpod of the Asian poppy plant. It can be mixed with water and injected with a needle. Heroin can also be smoked or snorted up the nose. All of these ways of taking heroin send it to the brain very quickly.  This makes it very addictive.\\nMajor health problems from heroin include miscarriages, heart infections, and death from overdose. People who inject the drug also risk getting infectious diseases, including HIV/AIDS and hepatitis.\\nRegular use of heroin can lead to tolerance. This means users need more and more drug to have the same effect. At higher doses over time, the body becomes dependent on heroin. If dependent users stop heroin, they have withdrawal symptoms. These symptoms include restlessness, muscle and bone pain, diarrhea and vomiting, and cold flashes with goose bumps. \\nNIH: National Institute on Drug Abuse\\n\",\n",

They spread quickly, and can damage natural resources, destroy homes, and threaten the safety of the public and firefighters.\\nHumans cause most wildfires. It can be an accident, like when people don't take care of their campfire properly, burn debris, or are careless when getting rid of their cigarettes. It can also be on purpose, which is called arson. Lightning and lava also can also causes wildfires. Wildfires are more common when conditions are dry. High winds can make them spread more quickly.\\nAlthough there are no guarantees of safety if you live in an area threatened by a wildfire, you can take actions to protect yourself. You should have a disaster plan. Being prepared can help reduce fear, anxiety, and losses. If you do experience a disaster, it is normal to feel stressed. You may need help in finding ways to cope.\\nFederal Emergency Management Agency\\n\",\n",

       " 'Genital Herpes': '\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nGenital herpes is a sexually transmitted disease (STD) caused by a herpes simplex virus (HSV). It can cause sores on your genital or rectal area, buttocks, and thighs.  You can get it from having vaginal, anal, or oral sex with someone who has it. The virus can spread even when sores are not present. Mothers can also infect their babies during childbirth.\\nSymptoms of herpes are called outbreaks.  You usually get sores near the area where the virus has entered the body. The sores are blisters which break and become painful, and then heal. Sometimes people do not know they have herpes because they have no symptoms or very mild symptoms. The virus can be more serious in newborn babies or in people with weak immune systems.\\nRepeat outbreaks are common, especially during the first year. Over time, you get them less often and the symptoms become milder.  The virus stays in your body for life.\\nThere are tests that can diagnose genital herpes. There is no cure.  However, medicines can help lessen symptoms, decrease outbreaks, and lower the risk of passing the virus to others. Correct usage of latex condoms can reduce, but not eliminate, the risk of catching or spreading herpes. If your or your partner is allergic to latex, you can use polyurethane condoms. The most reliable way to avoid infection is to not have anal, vaginal, or oral sex.\\n',\n",
       " 'Knee Replacement': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nWhat is knee replacement surgery?\\nKnee replacement surgery is a surgery to replace parts of your knee joint with new, artificial parts. You may need a knee replacement if you have knee damage that causes severe pain and difficulty doing daily activities, such as walking and climbing stairs. It is usually done when other treatments for knee pain haven't helped enough. The goal of a knee replacement is to relieve pain and help you move better.\\nPeople of all ages may have knee replacement surgery. But it is more common in older people. The decision whether to have surgery is based on your overall health and how much your knee bothers you.\\nWhat conditions does knee replacement surgery treat?\\nKnee replacement surgery treats conditions that cause the cartilage of the knee joint to wear away. These include:\\n\\nKnee osteoarthritis. This is the most common reason for knee replacement surgery. It usually develops over time after an injury or with aging.\\nKnee damage from other types of arthritis.\\nProblems from knee joints that aren't formed correctly.\\n\\nWhat happens during knee replacement surgery?\\nDuring the surgery, a surgeon removes damaged cartilage and some bone from the surfaces of your knee joint. Cartilage is tissue that covers your bones where they meet. Healthy cartilage is smooth and helps the bones glide over each other when you move. When cartilage becomes rough and wears away, the bones rub against each other, causing pain.\\nAfter removing the damaged knee cartilage and bone, the surgeon attaches the artificial parts to your bones. The artificial parts are made of metal and plastic. They will give your knee new, smooth surfaces.\\nKnee replacement surgery may replace all the damaged parts of your knee (total knee replacement) or just part of your knee (partial knee replacement). In a total knee replacement, the surgeon replaces 3 surfaces:\\n\\nThe end of the shinbone\\nThe end of the thighbone\\nThe back of the kneecap\\n\\nWhat happens after knee replacement surgery?\\nSome people go home the same day they have surgery. Other people will stay in the hospital a few days. To help prevent blood clots, you'll most likely take blood thinners and wear special socks or coverings on your legs for a short time after surgery.\\nThe success of your surgery depends a lot on what you do at home to help yourself recover. A physical therapist will teach you exercises to make your knee stronger and help it bend. It is important to do these exercises regularly. You may need to use a cane or walker for several weeks after the surgery. It will probably also be several weeks before you can drive. Your doctor will tell you when you can start driving again.\\nMost people who follow their recovery instructions can get back to nearly all of their normal daily activities within 3 to 6 weeks after surgery.\\nWhat is life like after a knee replacement?\\nAfter recovering from surgery, most people can move better with less pain than before surgery. But having an artificial knee is not the same as having a normal, healthy knee.\\nYou need to protect your new knee by:\\n\\nStaying at a healthy weight.\\nGetting regular physical activity.\\nNot doing any high-impact activities, such as jogging, running, and jumping. Instead, you can try low-impact activities that are good for your knee, such as walking, biking, and swimming\\n\\nWhat are the risks of knee replacement surgery?\\nThe chance of having problems after knee replacement surgery is low. But there are risks after any surgery. Possible problems after knee replacement surgery include:\\n\\nInfection\\nBlood clots\\nHeart attack\\nStroke\\nNerve damage\\nScarring that limits how far you can bend your knee\\n\\nYour age, general health, and how active you are can all affect your risk of having a problem after knee replacement surgery.\\nHow long does a knee replacement last?\\nA knee replacement doesn't last forever. After 15 to 20 years, the artificial knee parts may become loose or worn. If that happens, you may need another surgery on the same knee.\\nIf you're thinking about having knee replacement surgery, talk to your doctor about the risks and benefits. Together you can decide if a knee replacement is right for you.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Birth Defects': '\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nWhat are birth defects?\\nA birth defect is a problem that happens while a baby is developing in the mother\\'s body.  Most birth defects happen during the first 3 months of pregnancy. One out of every 33 babies in the United States is born with a birth defect.\\nA birth defect may affect how the body looks, works, or both. Some birth defects like cleft lip or neural tube defects are structural problems that can be easy to see. Others, like heart disease, are found using special tests. Birth defects can range from mild to severe. How a birth defect affects a child\\'s life depends mostly on which organ or body part is involved and how severe the defect is.\\nWhat causes birth defects?\\nFor some birth defects, researchers know the cause. But for many birth defects, the exact cause is unknown. Researchers think that most birth defects are caused by a complex mix of factors, which can include:\\nGenetics. One or more genes might have a change or mutation that prevents them from working properly. For example, this happens in Fragile X syndrome. With some defects, a gene or part of the gene might be missing.\\nChromosomal problems. In some cases, a chromosome or part of a chromosome might be missing. This is what happens in Turner syndrome. In other cases, such as with Down syndrome, the child has an extra chromosome. \\nExposures to medicines, chemicals, or other toxic substances. For example, alcohol misuse can cause fetal alcohol spectrum disorders.\\nInfections during pregnancy. For example, infection with Zika virus during pregnancy can cause a serious defect in the brain.\\nLack of certain nutrients. Not getting enough folic acid before and during pregnancy is a key factor in causing neural tube defects.\\n\\nWho is at risk of having a baby with birth defects?\\nCertain factors may might increase the chances of having a baby with a birth defect, such as:\\nSmoking, drinking alcohol, or taking certain \"street\" drugs during pregnancy\\nHaving certain medical conditions, such as obesity or uncontrolled diabetes, before and during pregnancy\\nTaking certain medicines\\nHaving someone in your family with a birth defect. To learn more about your risk of having a baby with a birth defect, you can talk with a genetic counselor,\\nBeing an older mother, typically over the age of 34 years\\n\\nHow are birth defects diagnosed?\\nHealth care providers can diagnose some birth defects during pregnancy, using prenatal testing.  That\\'s why it important to get regular prenatal care.\\nOther birth defects may not be found until after the baby is born. Providers may find them through newborn screening. Some defects, such as club foot, are obvious right away. Other times, the health care provider may not discover a defect until later in life, when the child has symptoms.\\nWhat are the treatments for birth defects?\\nChildren with birth defects often need special care and treatments. Because the symptoms and problems caused by birth defects vary, the treatments also vary. Possible treatments may include surgery, medicines, assistive devices, physical therapy, and speech therapy.\\nOften, children with birth defects need a variety of services and may need to see several specialists. The primary health care provider can coordinate the special care that the child needs.\\nCan birth defects be prevented?\\nNot all birth defects can be prevented. But there are things you can do before and during pregnancy to increase your chance of having a healthy baby:\\nStart prenatal care as soon as you think you might be pregnant, and see your health care provider regularly during pregnancy\\nGet 400 micrograms (mcg) of folic acid every day. If possible, you should start taking it at least one month before you get pregnant.\\nDon\\'t drink alcohol, smoke, or use \"street\" drugs\\nTalk to your health care provider about any medicines you are taking or thinking about taking. This includes prescription and over-the-counter medicines, as well as dietary or herbal supplements.\\nLearn how to prevent infections during pregnancy\\nIf you have any medical conditions, try to get them under control before you get pregnant\\n\\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention\\n',\n",

The CNS is made up of your brain and spinal cord.  Leukodystrophies damage the white matter of your CNS. The white matter includes:\\nNerve fibers, also called axons, which connect your nerve cells\\nMyelin, a layer of proteins and fatty materials that covers and protects the nerve fibers. It also helps speed up signals between the nerve cells.\\n\\nWhen the white matter is damaged, it can slow down or block the signals between nerve cells. This can cause many different symptoms, including trouble with movement, vision, hearing, and thinking.\\nThere are over 50 types of leukodystrophies. Some types are present at birth, while others may not cause symptoms until a child becomes a toddler. A few types mainly affect adults. Most types get worse over time.\\nWhat causes leukodystrophies?\\nLeukodystrophies are caused by genetic changes. These changes are usually inherited, meaning that they are passed from parent to child.\\nWhat are the symptoms of leukodystrophies?\\nThe symptoms of leukodystrophies depend on the type; they can include a gradual loss of:\\nMuscle tone\\nbalance and mobility\\nWalking\\nSpeech\\nAbility to eat\\nVision\\nHearing\\nBehavior\\n\\nThere can also be other symptoms, such as:\\nLearning disabilities\\nbladder issues\\nBreathing problems\\nDevelopmental disabilities\\nMuscle control disorders\\nSeizures\\n\\nHow are leukodystrophies diagnosed?\\nLeukodystrophies can be hard to diagnose because there are so many different types which can have different symptoms. Your health care provider may use many tools to make a diagnosis:\\nPhysical and neurological exams\\nA medical history, including asking about family history\\nImaging tests, such as an MRI or CT scan\\nGenetic testing to look for genetic changes that could cause leukodystrophies\\nLab tests\\n\\nWhat are the treatments for leukodystrophies?\\nThere is no cure for leukodystrophies. Treatment focuses on relieving symptoms and providing support. It may include:\\nMedicines to manage muscle tone, seizures, and spasticity (muscle stiffness)\\nPhysical, occupational, and speech therapies to improve mobility, function, and cognitive problems\\nNutritional therapy for eating and swallowing problems\\nEducational and recreational programs\\n\\nStem cell or bone marrow transplantation can be helpful for a few types of leukodystrophy.\\nOne type of leukodystrophy, CTX, is treatable if it is diagnosed early.

       " 'Coronary Artery Disease': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nCoronary artery disease (CAD) is the most common type of heart disease. It is the leading cause of death in the United States in both men and women.\\nCAD happens when the arteries that supply blood to heart muscle become hardened and narrowed. This is due to the buildup of cholesterol and other material, called plaque, on their inner walls. This buildup is called atherosclerosis. As it grows, less blood can flow through the arteries. As a result, the heart muscle can't get the blood or oxygen it needs. This can lead to chest pain (angina) or a heart attack.  Most heart attacks happen when a blood clot suddenly cuts off the hearts' blood supply, causing permanent heart damage.  \\nOver time, CAD can also weaken the heart muscle and contribute to heart failure and arrhythmias. Heart failure means the heart can't pump blood well to the rest of the body. Arrhythmias are changes in the normal beating rhythm of the heart.  \\nNIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute\\n\",\n",

The cells of your body need glucose for energy. A hormone called insulin helps the glucose get into your cells.\\nWith type 1 diabetes, your body doesn\\'t make insulin. With type 2 diabetes, your body doesn\\'t make or use insulin well. Without enough insulin, glucose builds up in your blood and causes high blood sugar levels.\\nWhat is diabetic heart disease?\\nDiabetic heart disease is a term for heart disease in people who have diabetes. If you have diabetes, you are much more likely to develop heart disease or have a stroke than people who don\\'t have diabetes. And you may start having these problems at a younger age.\\nOver time, the effects of high blood sugar from diabetes can include damage to the blood vessels and nerves in your heart. This damage increases your chance of developing heart diseases, including:\\n\\nCoronary artery disease (CAD). It happens slowly as a sticky material called plaque builds up in the arteries that supply your heart muscle with blood.\\nHeart failure. With this condition, your heart can\\'t pump enough oxygen-rich blood to meet the needs of your body.\\nCardiomyopathy. This is a group of diseases in which the heart muscle may become thick or stiff.\\n\\nWho is more likely to develop diabetic heart disease?\\nDiabetes puts you at serious risk for heart disease.

       " 'Anxiety': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nWhat is anxiety?\\nAnxiety is a feeling of fear, dread, and uneasiness. It might cause you to sweat, feel restless and tense, and have a rapid heartbeat.   It can be a normal reaction to stress. For example, you might feel anxious when faced with a difficult problem at work, before taking a test, or before making an important decision. It can help you to cope. The anxiety may give you a boost of energy or help you focus. But for people with anxiety disorders, the fear is not temporary and can be overwhelming.\\nWhat are anxiety disorders?\\nAnxiety disorders are conditions in which you have anxiety that does not go away and can get worse over time. The symptoms can interfere with daily activities such as job performance, schoolwork, and relationships.\\nWhat are the types of anxiety disorders?\\nThere are several types of anxiety disorders, including:\\nGeneralized anxiety disorder (GAD).People with GAD worry about ordinary issues such as health, money, work, and family. But their worries are excessive, and they have them almost every day for at least 6 months.\\nPanic disorder. People with panic disorder have panic attacks. These are sudden, repeated periods of intense fear when there is no danger. The attacks come on quickly and can last several minutes or more.\\nPhobias. People with phobias have an intense fear of something that poses little or no actual danger. Their fear may be about spiders, flying, going to crowded places, or being in social situations (known as social anxiety).\\n\\nWhat causes anxiety disorders?\\nThe cause of anxiety is unknown. Factors such as genetics, brain biology and chemistry, stress, and your environment may play a role.\\nWho is at risk for anxiety disorders?\\nThe risk factors for the different types of anxiety disorders can vary. For example, GAD and phobias are more common in women, but social anxiety affects men and women equally. There are some general risk factors for all types of anxiety disorders, including:\\nCertain personality traits, such as being shy or withdrawn when you are in new situations or meeting new people\\nTraumatic events in early childhood or adulthood\\nFamily history of anxiety or other mental disorders\\nSome physical health conditions, such as thyroid problems or arrhythmia\\n\\nWhat are the symptoms of anxiety disorders?\\nThe different types of anxiety disorders can have different symptoms.

You may also have a physical exam and lab tests to make sure that a different health problem is not the cause of your symptoms.\\nIf you don't have another health problem, you will get a psychological evaluation. Your provider may do it, or you may be referred to a mental health professional to get one.\\nWhat are the treatments for anxiety disorders?\\nThe main treatments for anxiety disorders are psychotherapy (talk therapy), medicines, or both:\\nCognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a type of psychotherapy that is often used to treat anxiety disorders. CBT teaches you different ways of thinking and behaving. It can help you change how you react to the things that cause you to feel fear and anxiety. It may include exposure therapy. This focuses on having you confront your fears so that you will be able to do the things that you had been avoiding.\\nMedicines to treat anxiety disorders include anti-anxiety medicines and certain antidepressants. Some types of medicines may work better for specific types of anxiety disorders. You should work closely with your health care provider to identify which medicine is best for you.

       " 'Gallbladder Diseases': '\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nYour gallbladder is a pear-shaped organ under your liver. It stores bile, a fluid made by your liver to digest fat. As your stomach and intestines digest food, your gallbladder releases bile through a tube called the common bile duct. The duct connects your gallbladder and liver to your small intestine.\\nYour gallbladder is most likely to give you trouble if something blocks the flow of bile through the bile ducts. That is usually a gallstone. Gallstones form when substances in bile harden. Rarely, you can also get cancer in your gallbladder.\\nMany gallbladder problems get better with removal of the gallbladder. Fortunately, you can live without a gallbladder. Bile has other ways of reaching your small intestine.\\n',\n",

       " 'Amino Acid Metabolism Disorders': '\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nMetabolism is the process your body uses to make energy from the food you eat. Food is made up of proteins, carbohydrates, and fats. Your digestive system breaks the food parts down into sugars and acids, your body\\'s fuel. Your body can use this fuel right away, or it can store the energy in your body. If you have a metabolic disorder, something goes wrong with this process.\\nOne group of these disorders is amino acid metabolism disorders. They include phenylketonuria (PKU) and maple syrup urine disease. Amino acids are \"building blocks\" that join together to form proteins. If you have one of these disorders, your body may have trouble breaking down certain amino acids. Or there may be a problem getting the amino acids into your cells. These problems cause a buildup of harmful substances in your body. That can lead to serious, sometimes life-threatening, health problems.\\nThese disorders are usually inherited. A baby who is born with one may not have any symptoms right away. Because the disorders can be so serious, early diagnosis and treatment are critical. Newborn babies get screened for many of them, using blood tests.\\nTreatments may include special diets, medicines, and supplements.  Some babies may also need additional treatments if there are complications.\\n',\n",

       " 'Antibiotic Resistance': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nAntibiotics are medicines that fight bacterial infections. Used properly, they can save lives. But there is a growing problem of antibiotic resistance. It happens when bacteria change and resist the effects of an antibiotic. Resistant bacteria may continue to grow and multiply. \\nEach time you take antibiotics there is a risk that the bacteria will become resistant. Resistant infections can be difficult and sometimes impossible to treat. They can spread to other people.  Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is one example. It causes infections that are resistant to several common antibiotics.Antibiotic resistance can cause problems. To help prevent antibiotic resistance:\\nDon't use antibiotics for viruses like colds or flu. Antibiotics don't work on viruses.\\nDon't ask your health care provider to give you an antibiotic. \\nWhen you take antibiotics, follow the directions carefully. Finish your medicine even if you feel better.  If you stop treatment too soon, some bacteria may survive and re-infect you.Do not share your antibiotics with others.\\nDon't save antibiotics for later or use someone else's prescription.\\n\\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention\\n\",\n",

Your kidneys clean your blood. If they are damaged, waste and fluids build up in your blood instead of leaving your body.\\nKidney damage from diabetes is called diabetic nephropathy. It begins long before you have symptoms. People with diabetes should get regular screenings for kidney disease. Tests include a urine test to detect protein in your urine and a blood test to show how well your kidneys are working.\\nIf the damage continues, your kidneys could fail. In fact, diabetes is the most common cause of kidney failure in the United States. People with kidney failure need either dialysis or a kidney transplant.\\nYou can slow down kidney damage or keep it from getting worse.

       " \"Paget's Disease of Bone\": \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nWhat is Paget's disease of bone?\\nPaget's disease of bone is a chronic bone disorder. Normally, there is a process in which your bones break down and then regrow. In Paget's disease, this process is abnormal. There is excessive breakdown and regrowth of bone. Because the bones regrow too quickly, they are bigger and softer than normal. They may be misshapen and easily fractured (broken). Paget's usually affects just one or a few bones.\\nWhat causes Paget's disease of bone?\\nResearchers do not know for sure what causes Paget's disease. Environmental factors may play a role. In some cases, the disease runs in families, and several genes have been linked to the disease.\\nWho is at risk for Paget's disease of bone?\\nThe disease is more common in older people and those of northern European heritage. If you have a close relative who has Paget's, you are much more likely to have it.\\nWhat are the symptoms of Paget's disease of bone?\\nMany people do not know that they have Paget's, because it often has no symptoms. When there are symptoms, they are similar to those of arthritis and other disorders. The symptoms include:\\nPain, which may be due to the disease or to arthritis, which can be a complication of Paget's\\nHeadaches and hearing loss, which can happen when Paget's disease affects the skull\\nPressure on the nerves, which can happen when Paget's disease affects the skull or spine\\nIncreased head size, bowing of a limb, or curvature of the spine. This can happen in advanced cases.\\nHip pain, if Paget's disease affects the pelvis or thighbone\\nDamage to the cartilage of your joints, which may lead to arthritis\\n\\nUsually, Paget's disease gets worse slowly over time. It does not spread to normal bones.\\nWhat other problems can Paget's disease of bone cause?\\nPaget's disease can lead to other complications, such as:\\nArthritis, because the misshapen bones can cause increased pressure and more wear and tear on the joints\\nHeart failure. In severe Paget's disease, the heart has to work harder to pump blood to affected bones. Heart failure is more likely if you also have hardening of the arteries.\\nKidney stones, which can happen when the excessive breakdown of the bone leads to extra calcium in the body\\nNervous system problems, since the bones can cause pressure on the brain, spinal cord, or nerves. There may also be reduced blood flow to the brain and spinal cord.\\nOsteosarcoma, cancer of the bone\\nLoose teeth, if Paget's disease affects the facial bones\\nVision loss, if Paget's disease in the skull affects the nerves. This is rare.\\n\\nHow is Paget's disease of bone diagnosed?\\nYour health care provider may use many tools to make a diagnosis:\\nA medical history, which includes asking about your symptoms\\nA physical exam\\nAn x-ray of the affected bones. Paget's disease is almost always diagnosed using x-rays.\\nAn alkaline phosphatase blood test\\nA bone scan\\n\\nSometimes the disease is found by accident when one of these tests is done for another reason.\\nWhat are the treatments for Paget's disease of bone?\\nTo avoid complications, it is important to find and treat Paget's disease early. The treatments include:\\nMedicines. There are several different medicines to treat Paget's disease. The most common type is bisphosphonates. They help reduce bone pain and stop or slow down the progress of the disease.\\nSurgery is sometimes needed for certain complications of the disease. There are surgeries to\\n\\t\\nAllow fractures (broken bones) to heal in a better position\\nReplace joints such as the knee and hip when there is severe arthritis\\nRealign a deformed bone to reduce the pain in weight-bearing joints, especially the knees\\nReduce pressure on a nerve, if enlargement of the skull or spine injuries effects the nervous system\\n\\n\\n\\nDiet and exercise do not treat Paget's, but they can help to keep your skeleton healthy. If you do not have kidney stones, you should make sure to get enough calcium and vitamin D through your diet and supplements. Besides keeping your skeleton healthy, exercise can prevent weight gain and maintain the mobility of your joints. Talk with your health care provider before you start a new exercise program. You need to make sure that the exercise does not put too much stress on the affected bones.\\nNIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases\\n\",\n",

You may try treatments such as lifestyle changes, medicines, and angioplasty, a procedure to open the arteries.  If these treatments don't help, you may need coronary artery bypass surgery.\\nThe surgery creates a new path for blood to flow to the heart.  The surgeon takes a healthy piece of vein from the leg or artery from the chest or wrist.  Then the surgeon attaches it to the coronary artery, just above and below the narrowed area or blockage. This allows blood to bypass (get around) the blockage. Sometimes people need more than one bypass.\\nThe results of the surgery usually are excellent. Many people remain symptom-free for many years. You may need surgery again if blockages form in the grafted arteries or veins or in arteries that weren't blocked before.

       " 'Understanding Medical Research': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nIt seems to happen almost every day -  you hear about the results of a new medical research study. Sometimes the results of one study seem to disagree with the results of another study.\\nIt's important to be critical when reading or listening to reports of new medical findings. Some questions that can help you evaluate health information include:\\n\\nWas the study in animals or people? \\nDoes the study include people like you? \\nHow big was the study?\\nWas it a randomized controlled clinical trial?\\nWhere was the research done? \\nIf a new treatment was being tested, were there side effects? \\nWho paid for the research?\\nWho is reporting the results?  \\n\\nNIH: National Institutes of Health\\n\",\n",
       " 'Syphilis': '\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nSyphilis is a sexually transmitted disease caused by bacteria. It infects the genital area, lips, mouth, or anus of both men and women. You usually get syphilis from sexual contact with someone who has it. It can also pass from mother to baby during pregnancy.\\nThe early stage of syphilis usually causes a single, small, painless sore. Sometimes it causes swelling in nearby lymph nodes. If you do not treat it, syphilis usually causes a non-itchy skin rash, often on your hands and feet. Many people do not notice symptoms for years. Symptoms can go away and come back.\\nThe sores caused by syphilis make it easier to get or give someone HIV during sex. If you are pregnant, syphilis can cause complications, or you could lose your baby. In rare cases, syphilis causes serious health problems and even death.\\nSyphilis is easy to cure with antibiotics if you catch it early. Correct usage of latex condoms greatly reduces, but does not completely eliminate, the risk of catching or spreading syphilis. If your or your partner is allergic to latex, you can use polyurethane condoms. The most reliable way to avoid infection is to not have anal, vaginal, or oral sex.\\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention\\n',\n",
       " 'Bleeding': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nBleeding is the loss of blood. It can be external, or outside the body, like when you get a cut or wound. It can also be internal, or inside the body, like when you have an injury to an internal organ.  Some bleeding, such as gastrointestinal bleeding, coughing up blood, or vaginal bleeding, can be a symptom of a disease.\\nNormally, when you are injured and start bleeding, a blood clot forms to stop the bleeding quickly. Afterwards, the clot dissolves naturally. To be able to make a clot, your blood needs blood proteins called clotting factors and a type of blood cell called platelets. Some people have a problem with clotting, due to another medical condition or an inherited disease. There are two types of problems:\\n\\nYour blood may not form clots normally, known as a bleeding disorder. This happens when your body does not make enough platelets or clotting factors, or they don't work the way they should.\\nYour blood may make too many clots, or the clots may not dissolve properly\\n\\nSometimes bleeding can cause other problems. A bruise is bleeding under the skin. Some strokes are caused by bleeding in the brain. Severe bleeding may require first aid or a trip to the emergency room.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Cryptosporidiosis': '\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nCryptosporidiosis (crypto) is an illness caused by a parasite. The parasite lives in soil, food, and water.

       " 'Benefits of Exercise': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nWe have all heard it many times before - regular exercise is good for you, and it can help you lose weight. But if you are like many Americans, you are busy, you have a sedentary job, and you haven't yet changed your exercise habits. The good news is that it's never too late to start. You can start slowly, and find ways to fit more physical activity into your life. To get the most benefit, you should try to get the recommended amount of exercise for your age. If you can do it, the payoff is that you will feel better, help prevent or control many diseases, and likely even live longer. \\nWhat are the health benefits of exercise?\\nRegular exercise and physical activity may:\\nHelp you control your weight. Along with diet, exercise plays an important role in controlling your weight and preventing obesity. To maintain your weight, the calories you eat and drink must equal the energy you burn. To lose weight, you must use more calories than you eat and drink.\\nReduce your risk of heart diseases. Exercise strengthens your heart and improves your circulation. The increased blood flow raises the oxygen levels in your body. This helps lower your risk of heart diseases such as high cholesterol, coronary artery disease, and heart attack.  Regular exercise can also lower your blood pressure and triglyceride levels. \\nHelp your body manage blood sugar and insulin levels.  Exercise can lower your blood sugar level and help your insulin work better. This can cut down your risk for metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes. And if you already have one of those diseases, exercise can help you to manage it. \\nHelp you quit smoking.  Exercise may make it easier to quit smoking by reducing your cravings and withdrawal symptoms. It can also help limit the weight you might gain when you stop smoking. \\nImprove your mental health and mood.  During exercise, your body releases chemicals that can improve your mood and make you feel more relaxed. This can help you deal with stress and reduce your risk of depression. \\nHelp keep your thinking, learning, and judgment skills sharp as you age.  Exercise stimulates your body to release proteins and other chemicals that improve the structure and function of your brain. \\nStrengthen your bones and muscles.  Regular exercise can help kids and teens build strong bones. Later in life, it can also slow the loss of bone density that comes with age. Doing muscle-strengthening activities can help you increase or maintain your muscle mass and strength. \\nReduce your risk of some cancers,  including colon, breast , uterine, and lung cancer. \\nReduce your risk of falls.  For older adults, research shows that doing balance and muscle-strengthening activities in addition to moderate-intensity aerobic activity can help reduce your risk of falling. \\nImprove your sleep.  Exercise can help you to fall asleep faster and stay asleep longer. \\nImprove your sexual health.  Regular exercise may lower the risk of erectile dysfunction (ED) in men. For those who already have ED, exercise may help improve their sexual function. In women, exercise may increase sexual arousal. \\nIncrease your chances of living longer.  Studies show that physical activity can reduce your risk of dying early from the leading causes of death, like heart disease and some cancers. \\n\\nHow can I make exercise a part of my regular routine?\\n\\nMake everyday activities more active. Even small changes can help. You can take the stairs instead of the elevator. Walk down the hall to a coworker's office instead of sending an email. Wash the car yourself. Park further away from your destination. \\nBe active with friends and family. Having a workout partner may make you more likely to enjoy exercise. You can also plan social activities that involve exercise. You might also consider joining an exercise group or class, such as a dance class, hiking club, or volleyball team. \\nKeep track of your progress. Keeping a log of your activity or using a fitness tracker may help you set goals and stay motivated. \\nMake exercise more fun. Try listening to music or watching TV while you exercise. Also, mix things up a little bit - if you stick with just one type of exercise, you might get bored. Try doing a combination of activities. \\nFind activities that you can do even when the weather is bad. You can walk in a mall, climb stairs, or work out in a gym even if the weather stops you from exercising outside. \\n\\n\",\n",

You may need to try several different medicines to find which one works best for you. Some people need to take more than one medicine. It\\'s important to take your medicine consistently. Don\\'t stop taking it without first talking with your provider.  Contact your provider if you have any concerns about side effects from the medicines.\\nPsychotherapy (talk therapy) can help you recognize and change troubling emotions, thoughts, and behaviors. It can give you and your family support, education, skills, and coping strategies. There are several different types of psychotherapy that may help with bipolar disorder.\\nOther treatment options include\\n    \\nElectroconvulsive therapy (ECT), a brain stimulation procedure that can help relieve symptoms. ECT is most often used for severe bipolar disorder that is not getting better with other treatments. It may also be used when someone needs a treatment that will work more quickly than medicines. This might be when a person has a high risk of suicide or is catatonic (unresponsive).\\nGetting regular aerobic exercise may help with depression, anxiety, and trouble sleeping\\nKeeping a life chart can help you and your provider track and treat your bipolar disorder. A life chart is a record of your daily mood symptoms, treatments, sleep patterns, and life events.\\n\\n\\n\\nBipolar disorder is a lifelong illness. But long-term, ongoing treatment can help manage your symptoms and enable you to live a healthy, successful life.\\nNIH: National Institute of Mental Health\\n',\n",
       " 'Bacterial Infections': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nBacteria are living things that have only one cell.  Under a microscope, they look like balls, rods, or spirals. They are so small that a line of 1,000 could fit across a pencil eraser. Most types of don't make you sick. Many types are helpful. Some of them help to digest food, destroy disease-causing cells, and give the body needed vitamins. Bacteria are also used in making healthy foods like yogurt and cheese.\\nBut infectious bacteria can make you ill. They reproduce quickly in your body. Many give off chemicals called toxins, which can damage tissue and make you sick. Examples of bacteria that cause infections include Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, and E. coli.\\nAntibiotics are the usual treatment. When you take antibiotics, follow the directions carefully. Each time you take antibiotics, you increase the chances that bacteria in your body will learn to resist them causing antibiotic resistance. Later, you could get or spread an infection that those antibiotics cannot cure.\\nNIH: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases\\n\",\n",
       " 'Bone Diseases': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nYour bones help you move, give you shape and support your body. They are living tissues that rebuild constantly throughout your life. During childhood and your teens, your body adds new bone faster than it removes old bone. After about age 20, you can lose bone faster than you make bone. To have strong bones when you are young, and to prevent bone loss when you are older, you need to get enough calcium, vitamin D, and exercise. You should also avoid smoking and drinking too much alcohol.\\nBone diseases can make bones easy to break. Different kinds of bone problems include:\\nLow bone density and osteoporosis, which make your bones weak and more likely to break \\nOsteogenesis imperfecta makes your bones brittle \\nPaget's disease of bone makes them weak \\nBones can also develop cancer and infections\\n Other bone diseases, which are caused by poor nutrition, genetics, or problems with the rate of bone growth or rebuilding\\n\\nNIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases\\n\",\n",

       " 'Blood Sugar': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nBlood sugar, or glucose, is the main sugar found in your blood. It comes from the food you eat, and is your body's main source of energy. Your blood carries glucose to all of your body's cells to use for energy.\\nDiabetes is a disease in which your blood sugar levels are too high. Over time, having too much glucose in your blood can cause serious problems.  Even if you don't have diabetes, sometimes you may have problems with blood sugar that is too low or too high.  Keeping a regular schedule of eating, activity, and taking any medicines you need can help.\\nIf you do have diabetes, it is very important to keep your blood sugar numbers in your target range. You may need to check your blood sugar several times each day. Your health care provider will also do a blood test called an A1C. It checks your average blood sugar level over the past three months. If your blood sugar is too high, you may need to take medicines and/or follow a special diet.\\nNIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases\\n\",\n",

       " 'Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia': '\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nWhat is leukemia?\\nLeukemia is a term for cancers of the blood cells. Leukemia starts in blood-forming tissues such as the bone marrow. Your bone marrow makes the cells which will develop into white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. Each type of cell has a different job:\\nWhite blood cells help your body fight infection\\nRed blood cells deliver oxygen from your lungs to your tissues and organs\\nPlatelets help form clots to stop bleeding\\n\\nWhen you have leukemia, your bone marrow makes large numbers of abnormal cells. This problem most often happens with white blood cells. These abnormal cells build up in your bone marrow and blood. They crowd out the healthy blood cells and make it hard for your cells and blood to do their work.\\nWhat is chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)?\\nChronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a type of chronic leukemia. \"Chronic\" means that the leukemia usually gets worse slowly. In CLL, the bone marrow makes abnormal lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell). When the abnormal cells crowd out the healthy cells, it can lead to infection, anemia, and easy bleeding. The abnormal cells can also spread outside the blood to other parts of the body.\\nCLL is one of the most common types of leukemia in adults. It often occurs during or after middle age. It is rare in children.\\nWhat causes chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)?\\nCLL happens when there are changes in the genetic material (DNA) in bone marrow cells. The cause of these genetic changes is unknown, so it\\'s hard to predict who might get CLL. There are a few factors that might raise your risk.\\nWho is at risk for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)?\\nIt is hard to predict who will get CLL. There are a few factors that could raise your risk:\\nAge - your risk goes up as you get older. Most people who are diagnosed with CLL are over 50.\\nFamily history of CLL and other blood and bone marrow diseases\\nRacial/ethnic group - CLL is more common in whites than in people from other racial or ethnic groups\\nExposure to certain chemicals, including Agent Orange, a chemical that was used in the Vietnam War\\n\\nWhat are the symptoms of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)?\\nIn the beginning, CLL does not cause any symptoms. Later, you can have symptoms such as:\\nSwollen lymph nodes - you may notice them as painless lumps in the neck, underarm, stomach, or groin\\nWeakness or feeling tired\\nPain or a feeling of fullness below the ribs\\nFever and infection\\nEasy bruising or bleeding\\nPetechiae, which are tiny red dots under the skin. They are caused by bleeding.\\nWeight loss for no known reason\\nDrenching night sweats\\n\\nHow is chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) diagnosed?\\nYour health care provider may use many tools to diagnose CLL:\\nA physical exam\\nA medical history\\nBlood tests, such as a complete blood count (CBC) with differential and blood chemistry tests. Blood chemistry tests measure different substances in the blood, including electrolytes, fats, proteins, glucose (sugar), and enzymes. Specific blood chemistry tests include a basic metabolic panel (BMP), a comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), kidney function tests, liver function tests, and an electrolyte panel.\\nFlow cytometry tests, which check for leukemia cells and identify which type of leukemia it is. The tests can be done on blood, bone marrow, or other tissue.\\nGenetic tests to look for gene and chromosome changes\\n\\nIf you are diagnosed with CLL, you may have additional tests to see whether the cancer has spread. These include imaging tests and bone marrow tests.\\nWhat are the treatments for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)?\\nTreatments for CLL include:\\nWatchful waiting, which means that you don\\'t get treatment right away. Your health care provider regularly checks to see if your signs or symptoms appear or change.\\nTargeted therapy, which uses drugs or other substances that attack specific cancer cells with less harm to normal cells.\\nChemotherapy\\nRadiation therapy\\nImmunotherapy\\nChemotherapy with bone marrow or stem cell transplant\\n\\nThe goals of treatment are to slow the growth of the leukemia cells and to give you long periods of remission. Remission means that the signs and symptoms of cancer are reduced or have disappeared. The CLL may come back after remission, and you may need more treatment.\\nNIH: National Cancer Institute\\n',\n",
       " 'Kidney Transplantation': '\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nA kidney transplant is an operation that places a healthy kidney in your body. The transplanted kidney takes over the work of the two kidneys that failed, so you no longer need dialysis. \\nDuring a transplant, the surgeon places the new kidney in your lower abdomen and connects the artery and vein of the new kidney to your artery and vein. Often, the new kidney will start making urine as soon as your blood starts flowing through it. But sometimes it takes a few weeks to start working. \\nMany transplanted kidneys come from donors who have died. Some come from a living family member. The wait for a new kidney can be long.\\nIf you have a transplant, you must take drugs for the rest of your life, to keep your body from rejecting the new kidney.\\nNIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases\\n',\n",

How much you need depends on your size, activity level, and the weather where you live.\\nThe water you drink is a combination of surface water and groundwater. Surface water includes rivers, lakes and reservoirs.  Groundwater comes from underground.  The United States has one of the safest water supplies in the world, but drinking water quality can vary from place to place. It depends on the condition of the source water and the treatment it receives. Treatment may include adding fluoride to prevent cavities and chlorine to kill \\ngerms. \\nYour water supplier must give you annual reports on drinking water. The reports include where your water came from and what contaminants are in it.\\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention\\n',\n",
       " 'Sprains and Strains': '\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nA sprain is a stretched or torn ligament. Ligaments are tissues that connect bones at a joint. Falling, twisting, or getting hit can all cause a sprain. Ankle and wrist sprains are common. Symptoms include pain, swelling, bruising, and being unable to move your joint. You might feel a pop or tear when the injury happens. \\nA strain is a stretched or torn muscle or tendon. Tendons are tissues that connect muscle to bone. Twisting or pulling these tissues can cause a strain. Strains can happen suddenly or develop over time. Back and hamstring muscle strains are common. Many people get strains playing sports. Symptoms include pain, muscle spasms, swelling, and trouble moving the muscle. \\nAt first, treatment of both sprains and strains usually involves resting the injured area, icing it, wearing a bandage or device that compresses the area, and medicines. Later treatment might include exercise and physical therapy. \\nNIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases\\n',\n",
       " 'Prostate Cancer': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nWhat is prostate cancer?\\nCancer is a disease in which cells in the body grow out of control. Prostate cancer begins in the cells of the prostate. The prostate is a gland in the male reproductive system. It lies just below the bladder. It makes fluid that is part of semen.\\nProstate cancer is one of the most common types of cancer. It often grows very slowly. If it does not spread to other parts of the body, it may not cause serious problems. But sometimes prostate cancer can grow quickly and spread to other parts of the body. This kind of prostate cancer is serious.\\nWhat causes prostate cancer?\\nResearchers don't know for sure what causes prostate cancer. They do know that it happens when there are changes in the genetic material (DNA).\\nSometimes these genetic changes are inherited, meaning that you are born with them. There are also certain genetic changes that happen during your lifetime that can raise your risk of prostate cancer. But often the exact cause of these genetic changes is unknown.\\nWho is more likely to develop prostate cancer?\\nAnyone who has a prostate can develop prostate cancer. But certain factors can make you more likely to develop it:\\n\\nAge. Your chance of developing prostate cancer increases as you get older. Prostate cancer is rare in people under age 50.\\nFamily health history. Your risk of prostate cancer is higher if you have a parent, sibling, or child who has or has had prostate cancer.\\nRace. African Americans are more likely to get prostate cancer.  They're also more likely to:\\n\\t\\nGet prostate cancer at a younger age.\\nHave more serious prostate cancer.\\nDie from prostate cancer.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat are the symptoms of prostate cancer?\\nProstate cancer doesn't always cause symptoms, especially at first. If it does cause symptoms, they may include:\\n\\nProblems urinating (peeing), such as:\\n\\t\\nA urine stream that's weak, hard to start, or starts and stops\\nSuddenly needing to urinate right away\\nUrinating often, especially at night\\nPain or burning when urinating\\nBlood in your urine or semen\\n\\n\\nPain in your lower back, hips, or pelvis that does not go away\\nPainful ejaculation (the release of semen through the penis during orgasm)\\n\\nBut many of these symptoms may be from other common prostate problems that aren't cancer, such as an enlarged prostate.\\nYou should discuss your prostate health with your health care provider if you:\\n\\nHave symptoms that could be prostate cancer\\nHave a high risk for developing prostate cancer\\nHad a screening test that suggests you could have prostate cancer\\n\\nWhat are prostate tests and how is prostate cancer diagnosed?\\nTests which check for prostate cancer include:\\n\\nA digital rectal exam (DRE). In this exam, your provider feels your prostate for lumps or anything unusual by inserting a lubricated, gloved finger into your rectum.\\nA prostate-specific antigen (PSA) blood test. A high PSA blood level may be a sign of prostate cancer. But many other things can cause high PSA levels, too.\\nImaging tests. These tests may use ultrasound or MRI to make pictures of your prostate.\\n\\nIf these tests show that you might have prostate cancer, the next step is usually a prostate biopsy. A biopsy is the only way to diagnose prostate cancer.\\nDuring a biopsy, a doctor uses a hollow needle to remove some prostate tissue. The tissue is studied under a microscope to look for cancer cells.\\nWhat are the treatments for prostate cancer?\\nYour treatment options usually depend on your age, your general health, and how serious the cancer is. Your treatment may include one or more of options:\\n\\nObservation,which is mostly used if you are older, your prostate cancer isn't likely to grow quickly, and you don't have symptoms or you have other medical conditions. Your doctor will keep checking on your cancer over time so to see whether you will need to start treatment for the cancer. There are two types of observation:\\n\\t\\nWatchful waiting means having little or no testing. If symptoms begin or change, you will get treatment to relieve them, but not to treat the cancer.\\nActive surveillance means having regular tests to see if your prostate cancer has changed. If the tests show the cancer is starting to grow or if you develop symptoms, then you will have treatment to try to cure the cancer.\\n\\n\\nSurgery to remove your prostate gland may be an option if your cancer hasn't spread outside of your prostate.\\nRadiation therapy uses high energy to kill cancer cells or prevent them from growing.\\nHormone therapy blocks cancer cells from getting the hormones they need to grow. It may include taking medicines or having surgery to remove the testicles.\\nChemotherapy uses medicines to kill cancer cells, slow their growth, or stop them from spreading. You might take the drugs by mouth, as an injection (shot), as a cream, or intravenously (by IV).\\nTargeted therapy uses drugs or other substances that attack specific cancer cells. This treatment causes less harm to healthy cells than radiation therapy or chemotherapy.\\nImmunotherapy helps your own immune system to fight cancer.\\n\\nCan prostate cancer be prevented?\\nMaking healthy lifestyle changes may help to prevent some prostate cancers. These changes include:\\n\\nBeing at a healthy weight\\nQuitting smoking\\nGetting enough exercise\\nEating healthy foods\\n\\nNIH: National Cancer Institute\\n\",\n",
       " 'Acoustic Neuroma': '\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nAn acoustic neuroma is a benign tumor that develops on the nerve that connects the ear to the brain. The tumor usually grows slowly. As it grows, it presses against the hearing and balance nerves. At first, you may have no symptoms or mild symptoms. They can include:\\n Loss of hearing on one side \\n Ringing in ears\\n Dizziness and balance problems\\n\\nThe tumor can also eventually cause numbness or paralysis of the face. If it grows large enough, it can press against the brain, becoming life-threatening.\\nAcoustic neuroma can be difficult to diagnose, because the symptoms are similar to those of middle ear problems.  Ear exams, hearing tests, and scans can show if you have it.\\nIf the tumor stays small, you may only need to have it checked regularly.  If you do need treatment, surgery and radiation are options.\\nIf the tumors affect both hearing nerves, it is often because of a genetic disorder called neurofibromatosis.\\nNIH: National Institute on Deafness and Communication Disorders\\n',\n",
       " 'Hepatitis B': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nWhat is hepatitis?\\nHepatitis is inflammation of the liver. Inflammation is swelling that happens when tissues of the body are injured or infected. It can damage your liver. This swelling and damage can affect how well your liver functions.\\nWhat is hepatitis B?\\nHepatitis B is a type of viral hepatitis. It can cause an acute (short-term) or chronic (long-term) infection. People with an acute infection usually get better on their own without treatment. Some people with chronic hepatitis B will need treatment.\\nThanks to a vaccine, hepatitis B is not very common in the United States. It is more common in certain parts of the world, such as sub-Saharan Africa and parts of Asia.\\nWhat causes hepatitis B?\\nHepatitis B is caused by the hepatitis B virus. The virus spreads through contact with blood, semen, or other body fluids from a person who has the virus.\\nWho is at risk for hepatitis B?\\nAnyone can get hepatitis B, but the risk is higher in:\\nInfants born to mothers who have hepatitis B\\nPeople who inject drugs or share needles, syringes, and other types of drug equipment\\nSex partners of people with hepatitis B, especially if they are not using latex or polyurethane condoms during sex\\nMen who have sex with men\\nPeople who live with someone who has hepatitis B, especially if they use the same razor, toothbrush, or nail clippers\\nHealth care and public-safety workers who are exposed to blood on the job\\nHemodialysis patients\\nPeople who have lived in or traveled often to parts of the world where hepatitis B is common\\nHave diabetes, hepatitis C, or HIV\\n\\nWhat are the symptoms of hepatitis B?\\nOften, people with hepatitis B don't have symptoms. Adults and children over 5 are more likely to have symptoms than younger children.\\nSome people with acute hepatitis B have symptoms 2 to 5 months after infection. These symptoms can include:\\nDark yellow urine\\nDiarrhea\\nFatigue\\nFever\\nGray- or clay-colored stools\\nJoint pain\\nLoss of appetite\\nNausea and/or vomiting\\nAbdominal pain\\nYellowish eyes and skin, called jaundice\\n\\nIf you have chronic hepatitis B, you may not have symptoms until complications develop. This could be decades after you were infected. For this reason, hepatitis B screening is important, even if you have no symptoms. Screening means that you are tested for a disease even though you don't have symptoms. If you are at high risk, your health care provider may suggest  screening.\\nWhat other problems can hepatitis B cause?\\nIn rare cases, acute hepatitis B can cause liver failure.\\nChronic hepatitis B can develop into a serious disease that causes long-term health problems such as cirrhosis (scarring of the liver), liver cancer, and liver failure.\\nIf you have ever had hepatitis B, the virus may become active again, or reactivated, later in life. This could start to damage the liver and cause symptoms.\\nHow is hepatitis B diagnosed?\\nTo diagnose hepatitis B, your health care provider may use many tools to make a diagnosis:\\nA medical history, which includes asking about your symptoms\\nA physical exam\\nBlood tests, including tests for viral hepatitis\\n\\nWhat are the treatments for hepatitis B?\\nIf you have acute hepatitis B, you probably don't need treatment. Some people with chronic hepatitis B don't need treatment. But if you have a chronic infection and blood tests show that hepatitis B could be damaging your liver, you may need to take antiviral medicines.\\nCan hepatitis B be prevented?\\nThe best way to prevent hepatitis B is to get the hepatitis B vaccine.\\nYou can also reduce your chance of hepatitis B infection by:\\nNot sharing drug needles or other drug materials\\nWearing gloves if you have to touch another person's blood or open sores\\nMaking sure your tattoo artist or body piercer uses sterile tools\\nNot sharing personal items, such as toothbrushes, razors, or nail clippers\\nUsing a latex condom during sex. If your or your partner is allergic to latex, you can use polyurethane condoms.\\n\\nIf you think you have been in contact with the hepatitis B virus, see your health care provider right away. Your provider may give you a dose of the hepatitis B vaccine to prevent infection. In some cases, your provider may also give you a medicine called hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG). You need to get the vaccine and the HBIG (if needed) as soon as possible after coming into contact with the virus. It is best if you can get them within 24 hours.\\nNational Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases\\n\",\n",
       " 'Prostate Cancer Screening': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nWhat is cancer screening?\\nCancer is a disease when the cells of the body grow out of control. Cancer screening is having tests to look for signs of cancer before you have any symptoms. By the time cancer causes symptoms, it may have already spread to other parts of your body. A screening test may help find cancer early, when it may be easier to treat.\\nCancer screening only tells you whether you might have cancer. It doesn't diagnose cancer. If a screening test shows signs of cancer, you'll need to have other tests to find out if you do have cancer and how serious it may be.\\nWhat is prostate cancer screening?\\nProstate cancer screening looks for signs of cancer in the prostate. The prostate is a gland in the male reproductive system. It lies just below the bladder. It makes fluid that is part of semen.\\nProstate cancer is most common in people over age 50. It usually grows slowly and doesn't cause health problems. In fact, it's possible to live a long life with prostate cancer and never know you have it. But in certain cases, prostate cancer may spread to other parts of the body and can be very serious.\\nThe goal of prostate cancer screening is to find prostate cancers that may be more likely to spread so they can be treated early.\\nWhat tests screen for prostate cancer?\\nTwo tests are commonly used to screen for prostate cancer:\\n\\nA prostate-specific antigen test, also called a PSA blood test. PSA is a protein made by your prostate. A high level of PSA in your blood may mean you have prostate cancer, but it's not proof of cancer.  That's because many other things may cause high PSA levels, including:\\n\\n\\nHaving an enlarged prostate (benign prostatic hyperplasia or BPH)\\nHaving other common prostate problems\\nTaking certain medicines\\n\\nIn general, the higher your PSA, the more likely it is that you have cancer. But a low PSA blood level isn't a guarantee that you don't have cancer. \\n\\n\\nDigital Rectal Examination (DRE). The DRE is a prostate exam.  In this exam, your health care provider inserts a lubricated, gloved finger into your rectum to feel your prostate for lumps or anything unusual. A DRE can check only one side of the prostate.\\n\\nA PSA test or a DRE may be able to detect prostate cancer at an early stage. But it is not clear whether early detection and treatment lower the risk of dying from prostate cancer. You should talk with your provider about the benefits and harms of prostate cancer screening.\\nWhat are the possible benefits and harms of prostate cancer screening?\\nThe possible benefits of prostate cancer screening include:\\n\\nFinding and treating prostate cancer early before it spreads\\nGetting a better sense of your prostate cancer risk (based on your PSA test)\\nPeace of mind if your screening shows you're unlikely to have prostate cancer now\\nThe option to choose further testing and closely monitor your prostate if your screening shows you may have cancer\\n\\nThe possible harms of prostate cancer screening include:\\n\\nGetting a false positive result. This means that your PSA test shows you may have prostate cancer when you really don't. A false positive may lead to:\\n\\n\\nWorry while you have more tests to look for signs of cancer.\\nA prostate biopsy.  In a biopsy, a doctor removes tissue from your prostate so it can be studied under a microscope to look for cancer cells. This is the only way to diagnose cancer. The possible harms of a prostate biopsy include:\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nFever\\nPain\\nBlood in semen\\nUrinary tract infection\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHaving prostate cancer treatment that you may not have needed. Prostate cancer screening may lead to a cancer diagnosis, but it's not always clear whether the cancer is likely to grow and spread. You could have unnecessary treatment for cancer that would never have caused any health problems. And the common prostate cancer treatments may have serious, permanent complications, such as: \\n\\n\\nUrinary incontinence\\nErectile dysfunction\\nProblems controlling your bowel movements (BMs)\\n\\n\\n\\nShould I be screened for prostate cancer?\\nSince there are benefits and risks to prostate screening, you should talk with your provider to decide if screening is right for you. You and your provider should consider:\\n\\nYour age. The risk of prostate cancer increases after age 50.\\nYour family health history. If members of your family have had prostate cancer, your risk may be higher.\\nYour race. Prostate cancer is more common in African Americans.  They also have a higher risk of developing prostate cancer at a younger age and having more serious disease. \\nYour general health.

       " 'Genetic Testing': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nWhat is genetic testing?\\nGenetic testing is a type of medical test that looks for changes in your DNA. DNA is short for deoxyribonucleic acid. It contains the genetic instructions in all living things. Genetic tests analyze your cells or tissue to look for any changes in:\\nGenes, which are parts of DNA that carry the information needed to make a protein\\nChromosomes, which are thread-like structures in your cells. They contain DNA and proteins.\\nProteins, which do most of the work in your cells.  Testing can look for changes in the amount and activity level of proteins. If it finds changes, it might be due to changes in your DNA.\\n\\nWhy is genetic testing done?\\nGenetic testing may be done for many different reasons, including to:\\nFind genetic diseases in unborn babies. This is one type of prenatal testing.\\nScreen newborn babies for certain treatable conditions\\nLower the risk of genetic diseases in embryos that were created using assisted reproductive technology\\nFind out if you carry a gene for a certain disease that could be passed on to your children. This is called carrier testing.\\nSee whether you are at increased risk of developing a specific disease. This may be done for a disease that runs in your family.\\nDiagnose certain diseases\\nIdentify genetic changes that may be causing or contributing to a disease that you were already diagnosed with\\nFigure out how severe a disease is\\nHelp guide your doctor in deciding the best medicine and dosage for you. This is called pharmacogenomic testing.\\n\\nHow is genetic testing done?\\nGenetic tests are often done on a blood or cheek swab sample. But they may also be done on samples of hair, saliva, skin, amniotic fluid (the fluid that surrounds a fetus during pregnancy), or other tissue. The sample is sent to a laboratory. There, a lab technician will use one of several different techniques to look for genetic changes.\\nWhat are the benefits of genetic testing?\\nThe benefits of genetic testing include:\\nHelping doctors make recommendations for treatment or monitoring\\nGiving you more information for making decisions about your health and your family's health:\\n\\t\\t\\nIf you find out that you are at risk for a certain disease, you might take steps to lower that risk. For example, you may find out that you should be screened for a disease earlier and more often. Or you might decide to make healthy lifestyle changes.\\nIf you find out that you are not at risk for a certain disease, then you can skip unnecessary checkups or screenings\\nA test could give you information that helps you make decisions about having children\\n\\n\\nIdentifying genetic disorders early in life so treatment can be started as soon as possible\\n\\nWhat are the drawbacks of genetic testing?\\nThe physical risks of the different types of genetic testing are small. But there can be emotional, social, or financial drawbacks:\\nDepending on the results, you may feel angry, depressed, anxious, or guilty. This can be especially true if you are diagnosed with a disease that does not have effective treatments.\\nYou may be worried about genetic discrimination in employment or insurance\\nGenetic testing may give you limited information about a genetic disease. For example, it cannot tell you whether you will have symptoms, how severe a disease might be, or whether a disease will get worse over time.\\nSome genetic tests are expensive, and health insurance might only cover part of the cost. Or they may not cover it at all.\\n\\nHow do I decide whether to be tested?\\nThe decision about whether to have genetic testing is complex. In addition to discussing the test with your health care provider, you can meet with a genetic counselor. Genetic counselors have specialized degrees and experience in genetics and counseling. They can help you understand the tests and weigh the risks and benefits. If you do get a test, they can explain the results and make sure that you have the support that you need.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Chiari Malformation': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nChiari malformations (CMs) are structural defects in the cerebellum. The cerebellum is the part of the brain that controls balance.  With CM, brain tissue extends into the spinal canal.  It can happen when part of the skull is too small, which pushes the brain tissue down. There are several types of CM.

       " 'Joint Disorders': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nWhat are joints?\\nYour joints are places where two or more bones come together. Your shoulders, elbows, hips, knees, and knuckles are all joints. Your spine has joints, too.\\nBut joints are more than bones. They include the soft tissues around them, such as cartilage, tendons and ligaments. Cartilage is the hard slippery flexible tissue that covers the ends of your bones at a joint. Tendons are tough, flexible bands that connect your muscles to your bones so you can move your joints. Ligaments connect the bones of the joint to each other to keep them stable when you move.\\nWhat are joint disorders?\\nJoint disorders are diseases or injuries that affect your joints. Injuries can happen because of overuse of a joint. Or you could have a sudden injury, such as an accident or a sports injury.\\nWhat diseases can affect the joints?\\nMany diseases can affect the joints. They often cause joint pain and make your joints stiff, red, or swollen. Most of them are chronic. That means they last a long time. Some may never go away completely. Some of the diseases that affect the joints include:\\n\\nArthritis. Arthritis may cause joint pain and swelling. There are many types of this disease. Osteoarthritis is the most common type. Over time, arthritis can cause severe joint damage. It can affect people of all ages. A joint injury when you're young may cause osteoarthritis later in life.\\nLupus. This autoimmune disease affects many parts of the body and can cause joint and muscle pain. Some types of lupus often cause arthritis.\\nSjögren's Syndrome. This autoimmune disease affects glands that make moisture in many parts of the body. The main symptoms are dry eyes and mouth, but it often causes joint pain, too.\\n\\nTreatments are different depending on the disease. But most treatments include medicines and therapies to relieve pain and other symptoms.\\nWhat types of joint disorders happen from sudden injuries?\\nJoint disorders from sudden injuries include:\\n\\nSprains and strains. Sprains are stretched or torn ligaments. Acute strains are stretched or torn muscles or tendons that happen from a sudden injury or movement, such as lifting a heavy object.\\nDislocated joints. A joint is dislocated when the bones are pushed or pulled out of position. A joint dislocation is a medical emergency.\\n\\nTreatment depends on the type of injury. You can treat many sports injuries at home. But you should call your health care provider if you:\\n\\nHave a lot of joint pain, swelling or numbness\\nCan't put weight on the joint\\nHave pain from an old injury with more swelling, an unstable joint, or a joint that isn't normal in another way\\n\\nWhat types of joint disorders happen from overuse?\\nOveruse injuries usually damage the soft tissues of the joint. They can happen when you work a joint too hard by doing the same movements over and over. For example, you could get an overuse injury from playing a musical instrument, playing sports, or doing certain jobs, such as carpentry or painting.\\nJoint overuse injuries include:\\n\\nBursitis. The bursa is a small fluid-filled sac. It works as a pad between the bones of a joint and the moving parts around it, such as muscles, tendons and skin. With bursitis, the bursa becomes irritated and swollen with extra fluid. Overuse is the most common cause, but injuries, infections and other conditions, such as arthritis, can cause bursitis.\\nTendinitis. This condition happens when you overuse a tendon. It swells and makes the joint painful to move.\\nChronic strain. A strain becomes chronic when your muscles or tendons stretch or tear slowly over time from repeating the same movements.\\n\\nThe treatments for bursitis, tendinitis, and chronic strain are often the same. They usually include rest, keeping the injured joint higher than your heart, and taking medicine to reduce swelling. Your provider may recommend gentle exercise and other treatment. In some cases, your provider may suggest an injection (a shot) of medicine into the joint. If these do not help, you may need surgery.\\nHow can I keep my joints healthy?\\nGetting enough physical activity is one of the most important things you can do to prevent or slow joint disorders. Activity strengthens the muscles around your joints and helps them work better.\\nWhen you play sports, wear the right equipment to protect your joints, such as knee pads. If you already have joint problems, ask your provider what type of activities are best for you.\\nNIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases\\n\",\n",

It happens when the body's immune system is badly damaged because of the virus. Not everyone with HIV develops AIDS.\\nHow does HIV spread?\\nHIV can spread in different ways:\\nThrough unprotected sex with a person with HIV. This is the most common way that it spreads.\\nBy sharing drug needles.\\nThrough contact with the blood of a person with HIV.\\nFrom mother to baby during pregnancy, childbirth, or breastfeeding.\\n\\nWho is at risk for HIV infection?\\nAnyone can get HIV, but certain groups have a higher risk of getting it:\\n\\nPeople who have another sexually transmitted disease (STD). Having an STD can increase your risk of getting or spreading HIV.\\nPeople who inject drugs with shared needles.\\nGay and bisexual men.\\nBlack/African Americans and Hispanic/Latino Americans. They make up a higher proportion of new HIV diagnoses and people with HIV, compared to other races and ethnicities.\\nPeople who engage in risky sexual behaviors, such as not using condoms.\\n\\nFactors such as stigma, discrimination, income, education, and geographic region can also affect people's risk for HIV.\\nWhat are the symptoms of HIV/AIDS?\\nThe first signs of HIV infection may be flu-like symptoms:\\nFever\\nChills\\nRash\\nNight sweats\\nMuscle aches\\nSore throat\\nFatigue\\nSwollen lymph nodes\\nMouth ulcers\\n\\nThese symptoms may come and go within two to four weeks. This stage is called acute HIV infection.\\nIf the infection is not treated, it becomes chronic HIV infection. Often, there are no symptoms during this stage. If it is not treated, eventually the virus will weaken your body's immune system. Then the infection will progress to AIDS. This is the late stage of HIV infection. With AIDS, your immune system is badly damaged. You can get more and more severe infections. These are known as opportunistic infections (OIs).\\nSome people may not feel sick during the earlier stages of HIV infection. So the only way to know for sure whether you have HIV is to get tested.\\nHow do I know if I have HIV?\\nA blood test can tell if you have HIV infection. Your health care provider can do the test, or you can use a home testing kit. You can also use the CDC Testing Locator to find free testing sites.\\nWhat are the treatments for HIV/AIDS?\\nThere is no cure for HIV infection, but it can be treated with medicines. This is called antiretroviral therapy (ART).  ART can make HIV infection a manageable chronic condition. It also reduces the risk of spreading the virus to others.\\nMost people with HIV live long and healthy lives if they get and stay on ART. It's also important to take care of yourself. Making sure that you have the support you need, living a healthy lifestyle, and getting regular medical care can help you enjoy a better quality of life.\\nCan HIV/AIDS be prevented?\\nYou can reduce the risk of spreading HIV by:\\nGetting tested for HIV.\\nChoosing less risky sexual behaviors.

They are also sometimes found on other coarse body hair, such as hair on the legs, armpits, mustache, beard, eyebrows, or eyelashes. Pubic lice on the eyebrows or eyelashes of children or teens may be a sign of sexual exposure or abuse.\\nPubic lice are parasites, and they need to feed on human blood to survive. They are one of the three types of lice that live on humans. The other two types are head lice and body lice. Each type of lice is different, and getting one type does not mean that you will get another type.\\nHow do pubic lice spread?\\nPubic lice move by crawling, because they cannot hop or fly. They usually spread through sexual contact. Occasionally, they may spread through physical contact with a person who has pubic lice, or through contact with clothing, beds, bed linens, or towels that were used by a person with pubic lice. You cannot get pubic lice from animals.\\nWho is at risk for pubic lice?\\nSince they spread mainly through sexual contact, pubic lice are most common in adults.\\nWhat are the symptoms of pubic lice?\\nThe most common symptom of pubic lice is intense itching in the genital area. You may also see nits (lice eggs) or crawling lice.How do you know if you have pubic lice?\\nA diagnosis of a pubic lice usually comes from seeing a louse or nit. But lice and nits can be difficult to find because there may be only a few present. Also, they often attach themselves to more than one hair, and they do not crawl as quickly as head and body lice. Sometimes it takes a magnifying lens to see the lice or nits.\\nPeople who have pubic lice should also be checked for other sexually transmitted diseases, and their sexual partners should also be checked for pubic lice.\\nWhat are the treatments for pubic lice?\\nThe main treatment for pubic lice is a lice-killing lotion. Options include a lotion that contains permethrin or a mousse containing pyrethrins and piperonyl butoxide. These products are available over-the-counter without a prescription. They are safe and effective when you use them according to the instructions. Usually one treatment will get rid of the lice. If not, you may need another treatment after 9-10 days.\\nThere are other lice-killing medicines that are available with a prescription from your health care provider.\\nYou should also wash your clothes, bedding, and towels with hot water, and dry them using the hot cycle of the dryer.\\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention\\n',\n",
       " 'Club Drugs': '\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nWhat are club drugs?\\nClub drugs are group of psychoactive drugs. They act on the central nervous system and can cause changes in mood, awareness, and behavior. These drugs are most often used by young adults at bars, concerts, nightclubs, and parties. Club drugs, like most drugs, have nicknames that change over time or are different in different areas of the country.\\nWhat are the different types of club drugs?\\nThe most commonly used types of club drugs include:\\nMDMA (Methylenedioxymethamphetamine), also called Ecstasy and Molly\\nGHB (Gamma-hydroxybutyrate), also known as G and Liquid Ecstasy\\nKetamine, also known as Special K and K\\nRohypnol, also known as Roofies\\nMethamphetamine, also known as Speed, Ice, and, Meth\\nLSD (Lysergic Acid Diethylamide), also known as Acid\\n\\nSome of these drugs are approved for certain medical uses. Other uses of these drugs are misuse.\\nWhat are date rape drugs?\\nDate rape drugs are any type of drug or alcohol used to make sexual assault easier. Someone could put one in your drink when you are not looking. Or you may be drinking alcohol or taking a drug, and a person may make it stronger without you knowing.\\nClub drugs are also sometimes used as \"date rape\" drugs. These drugs are very powerful. They can affect you very quickly, and you might not know that something is wrong. The length of time that the effects last varies. It depends on how much of the drug is in your body and if the drug is mixed with other drugs or alcohol. Alcohol can make the effects of drugs even stronger and can cause serious health problems - even death.\\nAre there steps I can take to protect myself from date rape drugs?\\nTo try to avoid date rape drugs,:\\nNever leave your drink unattended\\nDon\\'t accept drinks from other people\\nIf drinking from a can or bottle, open your drink yourself\\nLook out for your friends, and ask them to look out for you\\n\\n',\n",
       " 'Vitamin D': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nVitamins are substances that your body needs to grow and develop normally. Vitamin D helps your body absorb calcium. Calcium is one of the main building blocks of bone. A lack of vitamin D can lead to bone diseases such as osteoporosis or rickets.  Vitamin D also has a role in your nerve, muscle, and immune systems.\\nYou can get vitamin D in three ways: through your skin, from your diet, and from supplements. Your body forms vitamin D naturally after exposure to sunlight. However, too much sun exposure can lead to skin aging and skin cancer.  So many people try to get their vitamin D from other sources.\\nVitamin D-rich foods include egg yolks, saltwater fish, and liver.  Some other foods, like milk and cereal, often have added vitamin D. \\nYou can also take vitamin D supplements.  Check with your health care provider to see how much you should take.  People who might need extra vitamin D include:\\nOlder adults\\nBreastfed infants\\nPeople with dark skin\\nPeople with  certain conditions, such as liver diseases, cystic fibrosis and Crohn's disease\\nPeople who have obesity or have had gastric bypass surgery\\n\\nNIH: National Institutes of Health Office of Dietary Supplements\\n\",\n",

It may help to strengthen connections to a loved one. You may feel fulfillment from helping someone else. But sometimes caregiving can be stressful and even overwhelming. This can be especially true when caring for someone with Alzheimer's disease (AD).\\nAD is an illness that changes the brain. It causes people to lose the ability to remember, think, and use good judgment. They also have trouble taking care of themselves. Over time, as the disease gets worse, they will need more and more help. As a caregiver, it is important for you to learn about AD. You will want to know what happens to the person during the different stages of the disease. This can help you plan for the future, so that you will have all of the resources you will need to be able to take care of your loved one.\\nAs a caregiver for someone with AD, your responsibilities can include:\\nGetting your loved one's health, legal, and financial affairs in order. If possible, include them in the planning while they can still make decisions. Later you will need to take over managing their finances and paying their bills.\\nEvaluating their house and making sure it's safe for their needs\\nMonitoring their ability to drive. You may want to hire a driving specialist who can test their driving skills.

       " 'Heart Surgery': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nWhat is heart surgery?\\nHeart surgery can correct certain heart problems when other treatments haven't worked or can't be used.\\nIn some cases, heart surgery may be a medical emergency. For example, surgery for a severe heart attack may need to be done right away. In other cases, you can plan heart surgery ahead of time. Some heart surgeries are major operations, such as heart bypass surgery for blocked arteries in the heart. Other surgeries are more minor heart procedures, such as putting in a pacemaker.\\nWhat conditions does heart surgery treat?\\nThere are different types of heart surgery that can help treat many heart conditions:\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat conditions does heart surgery treat?\\nWhat does the heart surgery do?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCoronary artery disease (CAD) - when a sticky substance called plaque narrows or blocks the arteries that supply blood to your heart muscle.\\nMakes a new path for blood to flow around the blocked part of an artery in the heart. This is called a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), or heart bypass. It's the most common heart surgery in adults.\\n\\n\\nHeart valve diseases - problems with the valves that control the flow of blood through your heart.\\nRepairs heart valves.Replaces heart valves with a mechanical valve or a biologic valve made from pig, cow, or human heart tissue.\\n\\n\\nArrhythmia - problems with the rate or rhythm of your heartbeat. They are caused by changes in the electrical signals that control your heartbeat.\\nPlaces a pacemaker or an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) in the chest to correct your heartbeat.Treats atrial fibrillation with small cuts in the heart muscle. The cuts form scars that make a path for the heart's electrical signals (Maze surgery).\\n\\n\\nHeart failure - when your heart is too weak or stiff to pump enough oxygen-rich blood to meet your body's needs.\\nPlaces a device in the chest which may include:An implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) to help prevent sudden cardiac arrest.A biventricular pacemaker to coordinate the heart's pumping action so it's more powerful.A ventricular assist device to help the heart pump blood.A total artificial heart to pump blood for the heart.Replaces a seriously diseased heart with a heathy heart (heart transplantation).\\n\\n\\nHeart aneurysm - a balloon-like bulge in the wall of an artery. It can be life-threatening if the aneurysm tears or bursts.\\nRepairs or replaces the weak part of a heart artery using a patch or a tube made of fabric.\\n\\n\\nAngina - chest pain from coronary artery disease.\\nUses a laser to make small channels through part of the heart muscle (transmyocardial laser revascularization).\\n\\n\\nDamaged and abnormal heart structures, including congenital heart defects - heart structure problems that you're born with.\\nRepairs heart damage or problems with how the heart and blood vessels are formed. Repairs depend on the type of defect or damage.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat approaches do surgeons use to do heart surgery?\\nThe approach a surgeon uses to do heart surgery depends on your heart problem, your general health, and other factors. Approaches to heart surgery include:\\n\\nOpen-heart surgery (also called traditional heart surgery) is when the surgeon cuts the chest open to reach the heart. Because it's difficult to operate on a beating heart, medicines are used to stop the heart. A heart-lung bypass machine keeps oxygen-rich blood pumping through the body during the surgery.\\nOff-pump heart surgery is open-heart surgery on a beating heart without using a heart-lung bypass machine. The surgeon holds the heart steady with a device. Surgeons may use off-pump heart surgery to do coronary artery bypass grafts (CABG), but only in certain cases.\\nMinimally invasive heart surgery uses small cuts between the ribs. The cuts may be as small as 2 to 3 inches. The surgeon inserts tools into the chest through the cuts. This type of heart surgery may or may not use a heart-lung bypass machine.\\nRobotic-assisted surgery is a type of minimally invasive surgery. The surgeon uses a computer to control tools on the arms of a robot. This allows the surgeon to be very accurate when doing difficult operations.\\n\\nWhat are the risks of heart surgery?\\nLike all surgery, heart surgery has risks even though the results are often excellent. The risks include:\\n\\nBleeding\\nInfection, fever, and swelling\\nA problem from anesthesia (medicine that makes you sleep during surgery)\\nArrhythmia\\nDamage to the heart, kidneys, liver, and lungs\\nStroke\\n\\nThe risks of heart surgery tend to be higher if:\\n\\nThe surgery is an emergency.\\nYou have other medical conditions, including:\\n\\t\\nDiabetes\\nKidney diseases\\nLung diseases\\nPeripheral artery disease (PAD)\\n\\n\\n\\nNIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute\\n\",\n",
       " 'Stroke': '\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nWhat is a stroke?\\nA stroke happens when there is a loss of blood flow to part of the brain. Your brain cells cannot get the oxygen and nutrients they need from blood, and they start to die within a few minutes. This can cause lasting brain damage, long-term disability, or even death.\\nIf you think that you or someone else is having a stroke, call 911 right away. Immediate treatment may save someone\\'s life and increase the chances for successful rehabilitation and recovery.\\nWhat are the types of stroke?\\nThere are two types of stroke:\\nIschemic stroke is caused by a blood clot that blocks or plugs a blood vessel in the brain. This is the most common type; about 80% of strokes are ischemic.\\nHemorrhagic stroke is caused by a blood vessel that breaks and bleeds into the brain\\n\\nAnother condition that\\'s similar to a stroke is a transient ischemic attack (TIA). It\\'s sometimes called a \"mini-stroke.\" TIAs happen when the blood supply to the brain is blocked for a short time. The damage to the brain cells isn\\'t permanent, but if you have had a TIA, you are at a much higher risk of having a stroke.\\nWho is at risk for a stroke?\\nCertain factors can raise your risk of a stroke. The major risk factors include:\\nHigh blood pressure. This is the primary risk factor for a stroke.\\nDiabetes.\\nHeart diseases. Atrial fibrillation and other heart diseases can cause blood clots that lead to stroke.\\nSmoking. When you smoke, you damage your blood vessels and raise your blood pressure.\\nA personal or family history of stroke or TIA.\\nAge. Your risk of stroke increases as you get older.\\nRace and ethnicity. African Americans have a higher risk of stroke.\\n\\nThere are also other factors that are linked to a higher risk of stroke, such as:\\nAlcohol and illegal drug use\\nNot getting enough physical activity\\nHigh cholesterol\\nUnhealthy diet\\nHaving obesity\\n\\nWhat are the symptoms of stroke?\\nThe symptoms of stroke often happen quickly. They include:\\nSudden numbness or weakness of the face, arm, or leg (especially on one side of the body)\\nSudden confusion, trouble speaking, or understanding speech\\nSudden trouble seeing in one or both eyes\\nSudden difficulty walking, dizziness, loss of balance or coordination\\nSudden severe headache with no known cause\\n\\nIf you think that you or someone else is having a stroke, call 911 right away.\\nHow are strokes diagnosed?\\nTo make a diagnosis, your health care provider will:\\nAsk about your symptoms and medical history\\nDo a physical exam, including a check of\\n\\t\\nYour mental alertness\\nYour coordination and balance\\nAny numbness or weakness in your face, arms, and legs\\nAny trouble speaking and seeing clearly\\n\\n\\nRun some tests, which may include\\n\\t\\nDiagnostic imaging of the brain, such as a CT scan or MRI\\nHeart tests, which can help detect heart problems or blood clots that may have led to a stroke. Possible tests include an electrocardiogram (EKG) and an echocardiography.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat are the treatments for stroke?\\nTreatments for stroke include medicines, surgery, and rehabilitation. Which treatments you get depend on the type of stroke and the stage of treatment. The different stages are:\\nAcute treatment, to try to stop a stroke while it is happening\\nPost-stroke rehabilitation, to overcome the disabilities caused by the stroke\\nPrevention, to prevent a first stroke or, if you have already had one, prevent another stroke\\n\\nAcute treatments for ischemic stroke are usually medicines:\\nYou may get tPA, (tissue plasminogen activator), a medicine to dissolve the blood clot. You can only get this medicine within 4 hours of when your symptoms started. The sooner you can get it, the better your chance of recovery.\\nIf you cannot get that medicine, you may get medicine that helps stop platelets from clumping together to form blood clots. Or you may get a blood thinner to keep existing clots from getting bigger.\\nIf you have carotid artery disease, you may also need a procedure to open your blocked carotid artery\\n\\nAcute treatments for hemorrhagic stroke focus on stopping the bleeding. The first step is to find the cause of bleeding in the brain. The next step is to control it:\\nIf high blood pressure is the cause of bleeding, you may be given blood pressure medicines.\\nIf an aneurysm if the cause, you may need aneurysm clipping or coil embolization. These are surgeries to prevent further leaking of blood from the aneurysm. It also can help prevent the aneurysm from bursting again.\\nIf an arteriovenous malformation (AVM) is the cause of a stroke, you may need an AVM repair. An AVM is a tangle of faulty arteries and veins that can rupture within the brain. An AVM repair may be done through\\n\\t\\nSurgery\\nInjecting a substance into the blood vessels of the AVM to block blood flow\\nRadiation to shrink the blood vessels of the AVM\\n\\n\\n\\nStroke rehabilitation can help you relearn skills you lost because of the damage. The goal is to help you become as independent as possible and to have the best possible quality of life.\\nPrevention of another stroke is also important, since having a stroke increases the risk of getting another one. Prevention may include heart-healthy lifestyle changes and medicines.\\nCan strokes be prevented?\\nIf you have already had a stroke or are at risk of having a stroke, you can make some heart-healthy lifestyle changes to try to prevent a future stroke:\\nEating a heart-healthy diet\\nAiming for a healthy weight\\nManaging stress\\nGetting regular physical activity\\nQuitting smoking\\nManaging your blood pressure and cholesterol levels\\n\\nIf these changes aren\\'t enough, you may need medicine to control your risk factors.\\nNIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke\\n',\n",

       " 'X-Rays': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nX-rays are a type of radiation called electromagnetic waves. X-ray imaging creates pictures of the inside of your body. The images show the parts of your body in different shades of black and white. This is because different tissues absorb different amounts of radiation. Calcium in bones absorbs x-rays the most, so bones look white. Fat and other soft tissues absorb less and look gray. Air absorbs the least, so lungs look black.\\nThe most familiar use of x-rays is checking for fractures (broken bones), but x-rays are also used in other ways. For example, chest x-rays can spot pneumonia. Mammograms use x-rays to look for breast cancer.\\nWhen you have an x-ray, you may wear a lead apron to protect certain parts of your body. The amount of radiation you get from an x-ray is small. For example, a chest x-ray gives out a radiation dose similar to the amount of radiation you're naturally exposed to from the environment over 10 days.\\n\",\n",

       " 'Breast Cancer': '\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nWhat is breast cancer?\\nBreast cancer is a cancer that starts in breast tissue.  It happens when cells in the breast change and grow out of control. The cells usually form a tumor.\\nSometimes the cancer does not spread any further. This is called \"in situ.\" If the cancer spreads outside the breast, the cancer is called \"invasive.\" It may just spread to nearby tissues and lymph nodes. Or the cancer may metastasize (spread to other parts of the body) through the lymph system or the blood.\\nBreast cancer is the second most common type of cancer in women in the United States. Rarely, it can also affect men.\\nWhat are the types of breast cancer?\\nThere are different types of breast cancer. The types are based on which breast cells turn into cancer. The types include:\\nDuctal carcinoma, which begins in the cells of the ducts. This is the most common type.\\nLobular carcinoma, which begins in the lobules. It is more often found in both breasts than other types of breast cancer.\\nInflammatory breast cancer, in which cancer cells block lymph vessels in the skin of the breast. The breast becomes warm, red, and swollen. This is a rare type.\\nPaget\\'s disease of the breast, which is a cancer involving the skin of the nipple. It usually also affects the darker skin around the nipple. It is also rare.\\n\\nWhat causes breast cancer?\\nBreast cancer happens when there are changes in the genetic material (DNA). Often, the exact cause of these genetic changes is unknown.\\nBut sometimes these genetic changes are inherited, meaning that you are born with them. Breast cancer that is caused by inherited genetic changes is called hereditary breast cancer.\\nThere are also certain genetic changes that can raise your risk of breast cancer, including changes called BRCA1 and BRCA2. These two changes also raise your risk of ovarian and other cancers.\\nBesides genetics, your lifestyle and the environment can affect your risk of breast cancer.\\nWho is at risk for breast cancer?\\nThe factors which raise your risk of breast cancer include:\\nOlder age\\nHistory of breast cancer or benign (noncancer) breast disease\\nInherited risk of breast cancer, including having BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene changes\\nDense breast tissue\\nA reproductive history that leads to more exposure to the estrogen hormone, including\\n\\t\\nMenstruating at an early age\\nBeing at an older age when you first gave birth or never having given birth\\nStarting menopause at a later age\\n\\n\\nTaking hormone therapy for symptoms of menopause\\nRadiation therapy to the breast or chest\\nObesity\\nDrinking alcohol\\n\\nWhat are the signs and symptoms of breast cancer?\\nThe signs and symptoms of breast cancer include:\\nA new lump or thickening in or near the breast or in the armpit\\nA change in the size or shape of the breast\\nA dimple or puckering in the skin of the breast. It may look like the skin of an orange.\\nA nipple turned inward into the breast\\nNipple discharge other than breast milk. The discharge might happen suddenly, be bloody, or happen in only one breast.\\nScaly, red, or swollen skin in the nipple area or the breast\\nPain in any area of the breast\\n\\nHow is breast cancer diagnosed?\\nYour health care provider may use many tools to diagnose breast cancer and figure out which type you have:\\nA physical exam, including a clinical breast exam (CBE). This involves checking for any lumps or anything else that seems unusual with the breasts and armpits.\\nA medical history\\nImaging tests, such as a mammogram, an ultrasound, or an MRI\\nBreast biopsy\\nBlood chemistry tests, which measure different substances in the blood, including electrolytes, fats, proteins, glucose (sugar), and enzymes. Some of the specific blood chemistry tests include a basic metabolic panel (BMP), a comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), and an electrolyte panel.\\n\\nIf these tests show that you have breast cancer, you will have tests which study the cancer cells. These tests help your provider decide which treatment would be best for you. The tests may include:\\nGenetic tests for genetic changes such as BRCA and TP53\\nHER2 test. HER2 is a protein involved with cell growth. It is on the outside of all breast cells. If your breast cancer cells have more HER2 than normal, they can grow more quickly and spread to other parts of the body.\\nAn estrogen and progesterone receptor test. This test measures the amount of estrogen and progesterone (hormones) receptors in cancer tissue. If there are more receptors than normal, the cancer is called estrogen and/or progesterone receptor positive. This type of breast cancer may grow more quickly.\\n\\nAnother step is staging the cancer. Staging involves doing tests to find out whether the cancer has spread within the breast or to other parts of the body. The tests may include other diagnostic imaging tests and a sentinel lymph node biopsy. This biopsy is done to see whether the cancer has spread to the lymph nodes.\\nWhat are the treatments for breast cancer?\\nTreatments for breast cancer include:\\nSurgery such as\\n\\t\\nA mastectomy, which removes the whole breast\\nA lumpectomy to remove the cancer and some normal tissue around it, but not the breast itself\\n\\n\\nRadiation therapy\\nChemotherapy\\nHormone therapy, which blocks cancer cells from getting the hormones they need to grow\\nTargeted therapy, which uses drugs or other substances that attack specific cancer cells with less harm to normal cells\\nImmunotherapy\\n\\nCan breast cancer be prevented?\\nYou may be able to help prevent breast cancer by making healthy lifestyle changes such as:\\nStaying at a healthy weight\\nLimiting alcohol use\\nGetting enough exercisee\\nLimiting your exposure to estrogen by\\n\\t\\nBreastfeeding your babies if you can\\nLimiting hormone therapy\\n\\n\\n\\nIf you are at high risk, your health care provider may suggest that you take certain medicines to lower the risk. Some women at very high risk may decide to get a mastectomy (of their healthy breasts) to prevent breast cancer.\\nIt\\'s also important to get regular mammograms. They may be able to identify breast cancer in the early stages, when it is easier to treat.\\nNIH: National Cancer Institute\\n',\n",

       " 'Asthma': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nWhat is asthma?\\nAsthma is a chronic (long-term) lung disease. It affects your airways, the tubes that carry air in and out of your lungs. When you have asthma, your airways can become inflamed and narrowed. This can cause wheezing, coughing, and tightness in your chest. When these symptoms get worse than usual, it is called an asthma attack or flare-up.\\nWhat causes asthma?\\nThe exact cause of asthma is unknown. Genetics and your environment likely play a role in who gets asthma.\\nAn asthma attack can happen when you are exposed to an asthma trigger. An asthma trigger is something that can set off or worsen your asthma symptoms. Different triggers can cause different types of asthma:\\nAllergic asthma is caused by allergens. Allergens are substances that cause an allergic reaction. They can include\\n\\t\\nDust mites\\nMold\\nPets\\nPollen from grass, trees, and weeds\\nWaste from pests such as cockroaches and mice\\n\\n\\nNonallergic asthma is caused by triggers that are not allergens, such as\\n\\t\\nBreathing in cold air\\nCertain medicines\\nHousehold chemicals\\nInfections such as colds and the flu\\nOutdoor air pollution\\nTobacco smoke\\n\\n\\nOccupational asthma is caused by breathing in chemicals or industrial dusts at work\\nExercise-induced asthma happens during physical exercise, especially when the air is dry\\n\\nAsthma triggers may be different for each person and can change over time.\\nWho is at risk for asthma?\\nAsthma affects people of all ages, but it often starts during childhood. Certain factors can raise your risk of having asthma:\\nBeing exposed to secondhand smoke when your mother is pregnant with you or when you are a small child\\nBeing exposed to certain substances at work, such as chemical irritants or industrial dusts\\nGenetics and family history. You are more likely to have asthma if one of your parents has it, especially if it's your mother.\\nRace or ethnicity. Black and African Americans and Puerto Ricans are at higher risk of asthma than people of other races or ethnicities.\\nHaving other diseases or conditions such as obesity and allergies\\nOften having viral respiratory infections as a young child\\nSex. In children, asthma is more common in boys. In teens and adults, it is more common in women.\\n\\nWhat are the symptoms of asthma?\\nThe symptoms of asthma include:\\nChest tightness\\nCoughing, especially at night or early morning\\nShortness of breath\\nWheezing, which causes a whistling sound when you breathe out\\n\\nThese symptoms can range from mild to severe. You may have them every day or only once in a while.\\nWhen you are having an asthma attack, your symptoms get much worse. The attacks may come on gradually or suddenly. Sometimes they can be life-threatening. They are more common in people who have severe asthma. If you are having asthma attacks, you may need a change in your treatment.\\nHow is asthma diagnosed?\\nYour health care provider may use many tools to diagnose asthma:\\nPhysical exam\\nMedical history\\nLung function tests, including spirometry, to test how well your lungs work\\nTests to measure how your airways react to specific exposures. During this test, you inhale different concentrations of allergens or medicines that may tighten the muscles in your airways. Spirometry is done before and after the test.\\nPeak expiratory flow (PEF) tests to measure how fast you can blow air out using maximum effort\\nFractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) tests to measure levels of nitric oxide in your breath when you breathe out. High levels of nitric oxide may mean that your lungs are inflamed.\\nAllergy skin or blood tests, if you have a history of allergies. These tests check which allergens cause a reaction from your immune system.\\n\\nWhat are the treatments for asthma?\\nIf you have asthma, you will work with your health care provider to create a treatment plan. The plan will include ways to manage your asthma symptoms and prevent asthma attacks. It will include:\\nStrategies to avoid triggers. For example, if tobacco smoke is a trigger for you, you should not smoke or allow other people to smoke in your home or car.\\nShort-term relief medicines,  also called quick-relief medicines. They help prevent symptoms or relieve symptoms during an asthma attack. They include an inhaler to carry with you all the time. It may also include other types of medicines which work quickly to help open your airways.\\nControl medicines.  You take them every day to help prevent symptoms. They work by reducing airway inflammation and preventing narrowing of the airways.\\n\\nIf you have a severe attack and the short-term relief medicines do not work, you will need emergency care.\\nYour provider may adjust your treatment until asthma symptoms are controlled.\\nSometimes asthma is severe and cannot be controlled with other treatments. If you are an adult with uncontrolled asthma, in some cases your provider might suggest bronchial thermoplasty. This is a procedure that uses heat to shrink the smooth muscle in the lungs. Shrinking the muscle reduces your airway's ability to tighten and allows you to breathe more easily. The procedure has some risks, so it's important to discuss them with your provider.\\n\",\n",

       " 'How to Lower Cholesterol with Diet': '\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nWhat is cholesterol?\\nYour body needs some cholesterol to work properly. But if you have too much in your blood, it can stick to the walls of your arteries and narrow or even block them. This puts you at risk for coronary artery disease and other heart diseases.\\nCholesterol travels through the blood on proteins called lipoproteins. One type, LDL, is sometimes called the \"bad\" cholesterol. A high LDL level leads to a buildup of cholesterol in your arteries. Another type, HDL, is sometimes called the \"good\" cholesterol. It carries cholesterol from other parts of your body back to your liver. Then your liver removes the cholesterol from your body.\\nWhat are the treatments for high cholesterol?\\nThe treatments for high cholesterol are heart-healthy lifestyle changes and medicines. The lifestyle changes include healthy eating, weight management, and regular physical activity.\\nHow can I lower cholesterol with diet?\\nHeart-healthy lifestyle changes include a diet to lower your cholesterol. The DASH eating plan is one example. Another is the Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes diet, which recommends that you\\nChoose healthier fats.You should limit both total fat and saturated fat. No more than 25 to 35% of your daily calories should come from dietary fats, and less than 7% of your daily calories should come from saturated fat. Depending upon how many calories you eat per day, here are the maximum amounts of fats that you should eat:\\n\\n\\n\\nCalories per Day\\nTotal Fat\\nSaturated Fat\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1,500\\n42-58 grams\\n10 grams\\n\\n\\n2,000\\n56-78 grams\\n13 grams\\n\\n\\n2,500\\n69-97 grams\\n17 grams\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSaturated fat is a bad fat because it raises your LDL (bad cholesterol) level more than anything else in your diet. It is found in some meats, dairy products, chocolate, baked goods, and deep-fried and processed foods.\\nTrans fat is another bad fat; it can raise your LDL and lower you HDL (good cholesterol). Trans fat is mostly in foods made with hydrogenated oils and fats, such as stick margarine, crackers, and french fries.\\nInstead of these bad fats, try healthier fats, such as lean meat, nuts, and unsaturated oils like canola, olive, and safflower oils.\\nLimit foods with cholesterol. If you are trying to lower your cholesterol, you should have less than 200 mg a day of cholesterol. Cholesterol is in foods of animal origin, such as liver and other organ meats, egg yolks, shrimp, and whole milk dairy products.\\nEat plenty of soluble fiber. Foods high in soluble fiber help prevent your digestive tract from absorbing cholesterol. These foods include:\\nWhole-grain cereals such as oatmeal and oat bran\\nFruits such as apples, bananas, oranges, pears, and prunes\\nLegumes such as kidney beans, lentils, chick peas, black-eyed peas, and lima beans\\n\\nEat lots of fruits and vegetables. A diet rich in fruits and vegetables can increase important cholesterol-lowering compounds in your diet. These compounds, called plant stanols or sterols, work like soluble fiber.\\nEat fish that are high in omega-3 fatty acids. These acids won\\'t lower your LDL level, but they may help raise your HDL level. They may also protect your heart from blood clots and inflammation and reduce your risk of heart attack. Fish that are a good source of omega-3 fatty acids include salmon, tuna (canned or fresh), and mackerel. Try to eat these fish two times a week.\\nLimit salt. You should try to limit the amount of sodium (salt) that you eat to no more than 2,300 milligrams (about 1 teaspoon of salt) a day. That includes all the sodium you eat, whether it was added in cooking or at the table, or already present in food products. Limiting salt won\\'t lower your cholesterol, but it can lower your risk of heart diseases by helping to lower your blood pressure. You can reduce your sodium by instead choosing low-salt and \"no added salt\" foods and seasonings at the table or while cooking.\\nLimit alcohol. Alcohol adds extra calories, which can lead to weight gain. Being overweight can raise your LDL level and lower your HDL level. Too much alcohol can also increase your risk of heart diseases because it can raise your blood pressure and triglyceride level. One drink is a glass of wine, beer, or a small amount of hard liquor, and the recommendation is that:\\nMen should have no more than two drinks containing alcohol a day\\nWomen should have no more than one drink containing alcohol a day\\n\\nNutrition labels can help you figure out how much fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, fiber, and sodium is in the foods that you buy.\\nNIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute\\n',\n",

They try to have a neighborhood feel. Often, they don't have a fixed day-to-day schedule, and kitchens might be open to residents. Staff members are encouraged to develop relationships with residents.\\nSome nursing homes have special care units for people with serious memory problems such as Alzheimer's disease. Some will let couples live together. Nursing homes are not only for older adults, but for anyone who requires 24-hour care.\\nNIH: National Institute on Aging\\n\",\n",

       " \"Parkinson's Disease\": \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nParkinson's disease (PD) is a type of movement disorder. It happens when nerve cells in the brain don't produce enough of a brain chemical called dopamine. Sometimes it is genetic, but most cases do not seem to run in families. Exposure to chemicals in the environment might play a role.\\nSymptoms begin gradually, often on one side of the body.  Later they affect both sides. They  include:\\nTrembling of hands, arms, legs, jaw and face \\nStiffness of the arms, legs and trunk \\nSlowness of movement \\nPoor balance and coordination \\n\\nAs symptoms get worse, people with the disease may have trouble walking, talking, or doing simple tasks. They may also have problems such as depression, sleep problems, or trouble chewing, swallowing, or speaking.\\nThere is no specific test for PD, so it can be difficult to diagnose.  Doctors use a medical history and a neurological examination to diagnose it.\\nPD usually begins around age 60, but it can start earlier. It is more common in men than in women. There is no cure for PD. A variety of medicines sometimes help symptoms dramatically. Surgery and deep brain stimulation (DBS) can help severe cases. With DBS, electrodes are surgically implanted in the brain. They send electrical pulses to stimulate the parts of the brain that control movement.\\nNIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke\\n\",\n",

       " 'How to Lower Cholesterol': '\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nWhat is cholesterol?\\nYour body needs some cholesterol to work properly. But if you have too much in your blood, it can stick to the walls of your arteries and narrow or even block them. This puts you at risk for coronary artery disease and other heart diseases.\\nCholesterol travels through the blood on proteins called lipoproteins. One type, LDL, is sometimes called the \"bad\" cholesterol. A high LDL level leads to a buildup of cholesterol in your arteries. Another type, HDL, is sometimes called the \"good\" cholesterol. It carries cholesterol from other parts of your body back to your liver. Then your liver removes the cholesterol from your body.\\nThere are steps that you can take to lower your LDL (bad) cholesterol and raise your HDL (good) cholesterol. By keeping your cholesterol levels in range, you can lower your risk of heart diseases.\\nWhat are the treatments for high cholesterol?\\nThe main treatments for high cholesterol are lifestyle changes and medicines.\\nLifestyle changes to lower cholesterol\\nHeart-healthy lifestyle changes that can help you lower or control your cholesterol include:\\nHeart-healthy eating. A heart-healthy eating plan limits the amount of saturated and trans fats that you eat. It recommends that you eat and drink only enough calories to stay at a healthy weight and avoid weight gain. It encourages you to choose a variety of nutritious foods, including fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean meats. Examples of eating plans that can lower your cholesterol include the Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes diet and the DASH eating plan. \\nWeight Management. If you are overweight, losing weight can help lower your LDL (bad) cholesterol. This is especially important for people with metabolic syndrome. Metabolic syndrome is a group of risk factors that includes high triglyceride levels, low HDL (good) cholesterol levels, and being overweight with a large waist measurement (more than 40 inches for men and more than 35 inches for women).\\nPhysical Activity. Everyone should get regular physical activity (30 minutes on most, if not all, days).\\nManaging stress. Research has shown that chronic stress can sometimes raise your LDL cholesterol and lower your HDL cholesterol.\\nQuitting smoking. Quitting smoking can raise your HDL cholesterol. Since HDL helps to remove LDL cholesterol from your arteries, having more HDL can help to lower your LDL cholesterol.\\n\\nMedicines to lower cholesterol\\nFor some people, making lifestyle changes alone does not their lower cholesterol enough. They may also need to take medicines. There are several types of cholesterol-lowering drugs available. They work in different ways and can have different side effects. Talk to your health care provider about which medicine is right for you.\\nEven if you take medicines to lower your cholesterol, you still need to continue with lifestyle changes.\\nLipoprotein apheresis to lower cholesterol\\nFamilial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is an inherited form of high cholesterol. Some people who have FH may get a treatment called lipoprotein apheresis. This treatment uses a filtering machine to remove LDL cholesterol from the blood. Then the machine returns the rest of the blood back to the person.\\nSupplements to lower cholesterol\\nSome companies sell supplements that they say can lower cholesterol. Researchers have studied many of these supplements, including red yeast rice, flaxseed, and garlic. At this time, there isn\\'t conclusive evidence that any of them are effective in lowering cholesterol levels. Also, supplements may cause side effects and interactions with medicines. Always check with your health care provider before you take any supplements.\\n',\n",
       " 'HIV/AIDS and Infections': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nHaving HIV/AIDS weakens your body's immune system. It destroys the white blood cells that fight infection.

       " 'Hepatitis C': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nWhat is hepatitis C?\\nHepatitis is inflammation of the liver. Inflammation is swelling that happens when tissues of the body are injured or infected. Inflammation can damage organs.\\nThere are different types of hepatitis. One type, hepatitis C, is caused by the hepatitis C virus (HCV). Hepatitis C can range from a mild illness lasting a few weeks to a serious, lifelong illness.\\nHepatitis C can be acute or chronic:\\nAcute hepatitis C is a short-term infection. The symptoms can last up to 6 months. Sometimes your body is able to fight off the infection and the virus goes away. But for most people, an acute infection leads to chronic infection.\\nChronic hepatitis C is a long-lasting infection. If it is not treated, it can last for a lifetime and cause serious health problems, including liver damage, cirrhosis (scarring of the liver), liver cancer, and even death.\\n\\nHow is hepatitis C spread?\\nHepatitis C spreads through contact with the blood of someone who has HCV. This contact may be through:\\nSharing drug needles or other drug materials with someone who has HCV. In the United States, this is the most common way that people get hepatitis C.\\nGetting an accidental stick with a needle that was used on someone who has HCV. This can happen in health care settings.\\nBeing tattooed or pierced with tools or inks that were not sterilized after being used on someone who has HCV\\nHaving contact with the blood or open sores of someone who has HCV\\nSharing personal care items that may have come in contact with another person's blood, such as razors or toothbrushes\\nBeing born to a mother with HCV\\nHaving unprotected sex with someone who has HCV\\n\\nBefore 1992, hepatitis C was also commonly spread through blood transfusions and organ transplants. Since then, there has been routine testing of the U.S. blood supply for HCV. It is now very rare for someone to get HCV this way.\\nWho is at risk for hepatitis C?\\nYou are more likely to get hepatitis C if you:\\nHave injected drugs\\nHad a blood transfusion or organ transplant before July 1992\\nHave hemophilia and received clotting factor before 1987\\nHave been on kidney dialysis\\nWere born between 1945 and 1965\\nHave abnormal liver tests or liver disease\\nHave been in contact with blood or infected needles at work\\nHave had tattoos or body piercings\\nHave worked or lived in a prison\\nWere born to a mother with hepatitis C\\nHave HIV/AIDS\\nHave had more than one sex partner in the last 6 months\\nHave had a sexually transmitted disease\\nAre a man who has had sex with men\\n\\nIf you are at high risk for hepatitis C, your health care provider will likely recommend that you get tested for it.\\nWhat are the symptoms of hepatitis C?\\nMost people with hepatitis C have no symptoms. Some people with acute hepatitis C do have symptoms within 1 to 3 months after they are exposed to the virus. These symptoms may include:\\nDark yellow urine\\nFatigue\\nFever\\nGray- or clay-colored stools\\nJoint pain\\nLoss of appetite\\nNausea and/or vomiting\\nPain in your abdomen\\nJaundice (yellowish eyes and skin)\\n\\nIf you have chronic hepatitis C, you probably will not have symptoms until it causes complications. This can happen decades after you were infected. For this reason, hepatitis C screening is important, even if you have no symptoms.\\nWhat other problems can hepatitis C cause?\\nWithout treatment, hepatitis C may lead to cirrhosis, liver failure, and liver cancer. Early diagnosis and treatment of hepatitis C can prevent these complications.\\nHow is hepatitis C diagnosed?\\nHealth care providers diagnose hepatitis C based on your medical history, a physical exam, and blood tests.\\nIf you do have hepatitis C, you may need additional tests to check for liver damage. These tests may include other blood tests, an ultrasound of the liver, and a liver biopsy.\\nWhat are the treatments for hepatitis C?\\nTreatment for hepatitis C is with antiviral medicines. They can cure the disease in most cases.\\nIf you have acute hepatitis C, your health care provider may wait to see if your infection becomes chronic before starting treatment.\\nIf your hepatitis C causes cirrhosis, you should see a doctor who specializes in liver diseases. Treatments for health problems related to cirrhosis include medicines, surgery, and other medical procedures. If your hepatitis C leads to liver failure or liver cancer, you may need a liver transplant.\\nCan hepatitis C be prevented?\\nThere is no vaccine for hepatitis C. But you can help protect yourself from hepatitis C infection by:\\nNot sharing drug needles or other drug materials\\nWearing gloves if you have to touch another person's blood or open sores\\nMaking sure your tattoo artist or body piercer uses sterile tools and unopened ink\\nNot sharing personal items such toothbrushes, razors, or nail clippers\\nUsing a latex condom during sex.

       " 'Hip Injuries and Disorders': '\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nYour hip is the joint where your femur (thigh bone) meets your pelvis (hip bone). There are two main parts: a ball at the end of the femur, which fits in a socket in the pelvis. Your hip is known as a ball-and-socket joint. This is because you have a ball at the end of your femur, and it fits into a socket in your pelvis. This makes your hips very stable and allows for a wide range of motion. When they are healthy, it takes great force to hurt them. However, playing sports, running, overuse, or falling can sometimes lead to hip injuries such as:\\n Strains\\n Bursitis\\n Dislocations\\n Fractures (broken bones)\\n\\nCertain diseases also lead to hip injuries or problems. Osteoarthritis can cause pain \\nand limited motion. Osteoporosis of the hip causes weak bones that break easily. Both of \\nthese are common in older people.\\nAnother problem is hip dysplasia, where the ball at the end of the femur is loose in the hip socket. It can cause hip dislocation. Babies who have hip dysplasia are usually born with it, but sometimes they develop it later.\\nTreatment for hip disorders may include rest, medicines, physical therapy, or surgery, including hip replacement.  \\n',\n",

To treat a spider bite:\\n\\n\\n\\nWash the area well with soap and water\\nApply an ice pack or a wet compress to the area\\nTake over-the-counter pain medicine, if needed\\nConsider using antihistamines for severe swelling\\nSeek medical treatment for small children and adults with severe symptoms\\n\\n\\n',\n",
       " 'Evaluating Health Information': '\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nWhy do I need to evaluate health information?\\nHealth information is easy to find. But finding reliable health information takes a little effort. Some of the health information you get from newspapers, magazines, books, TV, the Internet, and social media is up to date and trustworthy. But some is not. That\\'s why it\\'s important to evaluate health information for yourself.\\nBut how can you tell the good from the bad? There are two key steps:\\n\\nAsk questions before you trust what you read or hear.\\nDiscuss the information you find with your health care provider before you rely on it. You may have found good information, but your provider can tell you whether it\\'s good for you.\\n\\nHow can I evaluate health information on the Internet?\\nAsking a few questions will help you decide if you can trust a website. You can usually find most of the answers on the site\\'s \"About Us\" page.  If you can\\'t find information about who runs the website, the site may not be trustworthy, and their health information may be unreliable. Some questions to ask are:\\n\\nWho runs the site? Can you trust them to provide balanced, accurate information? Trustworthy sites provide a way to contact the owners with questions or feedback.\\n\\nIn general, you\\'ll find good health information on websites run by:\\n \\nFederal government agencies.\\nMedical schools.\\nLarge professional or nonprofit organizations. For example, the American College of Cardiology (a professional organization) and the American Heart Association (a nonprofit) and are both reliable sources of information on heart health.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat\\'s the purpose of the site? Is it to:\\n \\nInform the public?\\nSell products or services?\\nPromote the opinions of a person or group?\\n\\n\\nA trustworthy website has one goal: To give you good information.\\n\\n\\nWho pays for the site?\\n\\n\\nIf the site is funded by ads, they should be clearly marked as advertisements.  Watch out for ads designed to look like neutral health information. \\n \\nIf a business pays for the site, the health information may favor that business and its products.\\n\\n\\n\\nIs the health information high quality? Good health information doesn\\'t promote one treatment over another. It gives you balanced facts based on research. So, beware of dramatic writing, promises of cures, and claims that sound too good to be true. Those could be signs of a health fraud scam. To evaluate the quality of a website\\'s information, ask: \\n\\n\\nHow is the information selected and reviewed to make sure it\\'s accurate?\\n\\nCheck the \"About Us\" page to see if the site has:\\n  \\nAn editorial board of health experts\\nA content review process\\nA selection policy for content\\nInformation about their writers\\' qualifications, which may be listed at the bottom of the articles\\n\\n\\nWhere does the information come from? The content pages should have links or references to the sources of the information.\\nIs the information up to date? Content pages should include dates when the information was written, reviewed, or updated.\\n\\n\\n\\nHow does the website use your personal information? Look for a privacy policy section to see how your personal information will be used. Don\\'t share information about yourself unless you\\'re comfortable with any risks involved.\\n\\nWhen you find a website that seems to be trustworthy, don\\'t stop there. Look to see if other reliable sites have similar health information.\\nHow can I evaluate health information on social media?\\nA social media post may come from someone you know, but that doesn\\'t guarantee it\\'s good information. Many of the questions you use to evaluate a website also work for social media too. Ask where the information comes from, why it exists, and if anyone is funding it.\\nIf you\\'re not sure whether the information you see on social media is trustworthy, don\"t share it with others.\\nHow can I evaluate health stories in the news?\\nSome news stories about medical research may not include all the facts you need to know.  Ask these questions:\\n\\nDoes the story say whether the research involved people or animals?\\nIf it was people, how many people were in the study and who were they?\\nHow long was the study?\\nWhat type of study was it?\\nWho paid for the research?\\n\\nIf you learn a few tips for understanding medical research, you\\'ll be able to decide if a news story may apply to your health. Then you can discuss the information with your provider.\\nHow can I evaluate health information in books?\\nTo evaluate health information in books, ask:\\n\\nHow old is the book?\\nIs the author an expert on the subject?\\nDoes the book offer different points of view or just those of the author?\\nHas the book been reviewed by other experts?\\nDoes the book list the sources of the content?\\n\\nAfter you evaluate health information, talk with your provider before using it to make decisions that may affect your health.\\nNIH: National Library of Medicine\\n',\n",
       " 'HIV: PrEP and PEP': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nWhat are PrEP and PEP?\\nPrEP and PEP are medicines to prevent HIV. Each type is used in a different situation:\\nPrEP stands for pre-exposure prophylaxis. It is for people who don't already have HIV but are at very high risk of getting it. PrEP is daily medicine that can reduce this risk. With PrEP, if you do get exposed to HIV, the medicine can stop HIV from taking hold and spreading throughout your body.\\nPEP stands for post-exposure prophylaxis. PEP is for people who have possibly been exposed to HIV. It is only for emergency situations. PEP must be started within 72 hours after a possible exposure to HIV.\\n\\nPrEP (pre-exposure prophylaxis)\\nWho should consider taking PrEP?\\nPrEP is for people without HIV who are at very high risk for getting it. This includes:\\nGay/bisexual men who:\\nHave an HIV-positive partner\\nHave multiple partners, a partner with multiple partners, or a partner whose HIV status is unknown and\\n\\t\\nHave anal sex without a condom OR\\nHave been diagnosed with a sexually transmitted disease (STD) in the last 6 months\\n\\n\\n\\nHeterosexual men and women who:\\nHave an HIV-positive partner\\nHave multiple partners, a partner with multiple partners, or a partner whose HIV status is unknown and\\n\\t\\nDon't always use a condom when having sex with people who inject drugs OR\\nDon't always use a condom when having sex with bisexual men\\n\\n\\n\\nPeople who inject drugs and:\\nShare needles or other equipment to inject drugs OR\\nAre at risk for getting HIV from sex\\n\\nIf you have a partner who is HIV-positive and are considering getting pregnant, talk to your health care provider about PrEP. Taking it may help protect you and your baby from getting HIV infection while you try to get pregnant, during pregnancy, or while breastfeeding.\\nHow well does PrEP work?\\nPrEP is very effective when you take it every day. It reduces the risk of getting HIV from sex by more than 90%. In people who inject drugs, it reduces the risk of HIV by more than 70%. PrEP is much less effective if you do not take it consistently.\\nPrEP does not protect against other STDs, so you should still use latex condoms every time you have sex. If your or your partner is allergic to latex, you can use polyurethane condoms.\\nYou must have an HIV test every 3 months while taking PrEP, so you'll have regular follow-up visits with your health care provider. If you are having trouble taking PrEP every day or if you want to stop taking PrEP, talk to your health care provider.\\nDoes PrEP cause side effects?\\nSome people taking PrEP may have side effects, like nausea. The side effects are usually not serious and often get better over time. If you are taking PrEP, tell your health care provider if you have a side effect that bothers you or that does not go away.\\nPEP (post-exposure prophylaxis)\\nWho should consider taking PEP?\\nIf you are HIV-negative and you think you may have been recently exposed to HIV, contact your health care provider immediately or go to an emergency room right away.\\nYou may be prescribed PEP if you are HIV negative or don't know your HIV status, and in the last 72 hours you:\\nThink you may have been exposed to HIV during sex,\\nShared needles or drug preparation equipment, OR\\nWere sexually assaulted\\n\\nYour health care provider or emergency room doctor will help to decide whether PEP is right for you.\\nPEP may also be given to a health care worker after a possible exposure to HIV at work, for example, from a needlestick injury.\\nWhen should I start PEP and how long do I need to take it?\\nPEP must be started within 72 hours (3 days) after a possible exposure to HIV. The sooner you start it, the better; every hour counts.\\nYou need to take the PEP medicines every day for 28 days. You will have to see your health care provider at certain times during and after taking the PEP, so you can have an HIV screening test and other testing.\\nDoes PEP cause side effects?\\nSome people taking PEP may have side effects, like nausea. The side effects are usually not serious and often get better over time. If you are taking PEP, tell your health care provider if you have a side effect that bothers you or that does not go away.\\nPEP medicines may also interact with other medicines that a person is taking (called a drug interaction). So it's important to tell your health care provider about any other medicines that you take.\\nCan I take PEP every time I have unprotected sex?\\nPEP is only for emergency situations. It is not the right choice for people who may be exposed to HIV frequently - for example, if you often have sex without a condom with a partner who is HIV-positive. In that case, you should talk to your health care provider about whether PrEP (pre-exposure prophylaxis) would be right for you.\\n\",\n",

       " 'Lewy Body Dementia': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nWhat is Lewy body dementia (LBD)?\\nLewy body dementia (LBD) is one of the most common types of dementia in older adults. Dementia is a loss of mental functions that is severe enough to affect your daily life and activities. These functions include:\\nMemory\\nLanguage skills\\nVisual perception (your ability to make sense of what you see)\\nProblem solving\\nTrouble with everyday tasks\\nThe ability to focus and pay attention\\n\\nWhat are the types of Lewy body dementia (LBD)?\\nThere are two types of LBD: dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson's disease dementia.\\nBoth types cause the same changes in the brain. And, over time, they can cause similar symptoms. The main difference is in when the cognitive (thinking) and movement symptoms start.\\nDementia with Lewy bodies causes problems with thinking ability that seem similar to Alzheimer's disease. Later, it also causes other symptoms, such as movement symptoms, visual hallucinations, and certain sleep disorders. It also causes more trouble with mental activities than with memory.\\nParkinson's disease dementia starts as a movement disorder. It first causes the symptoms of Parkinson's disease: slowed movement, muscle stiffness, tremor, and a shuffling walk. Later on, it causes dementia.\\nWhat causes Lewy body dementia (LBD)?\\nLBD happens when Lewy bodies build up in parts of the brain that control memory, thinking, and movement.  Lewy bodies are abnormal deposits of a protein called alpha-synuclein. Researchers don't know exactly why these deposits form. But they do know that other diseases, such as Parkinson's disease, also involve a build-up of that protein.\\nWho is at risk for Lewy body dementia (LBD)?\\nThe biggest risk factor for LBD is age; most people who get it are over age 50. People who have a family history of LBD are also at higher risk.\\nWhat are the symptoms of Lewy body dementia (LBD)?\\nLBD is a progressive disease. This means that the symptoms start slowly and get worse over time. The most common symptoms include changes in cognition, movement, sleep, and behavior:\\nDementia, which is a loss of mental functions that is severe enough to affect your daily life and activities\\nChanges in concentration, attention, alertness, and wakefulness. These changes usually happen from day to day. But sometimes they can also happen throughout the same day.\\nVisual hallucinations, which means seeing things that are not there\\nProblems with movement and posture, including slowness of movement, difficulty walking, and muscle stiffness. These are called parkinsonian motor symptoms.\\nREM sleep behavior disorder, a condition in which a person seems to act out dreams. It may include vivid dreaming, talking in one's sleep, violent movements, or falling out of bed. This may be the earliest symptom of LBD in some people. It can appear several years before any other LBD symptoms.\\nChanges in behavior and mood, such as depression, anxiety, and apathy (a lack of interest in normal daily activities or events)\\n\\nIn the early stages of LBD, symptoms can be mild, and people can function fairly normally. As the disease gets worse, people with LBD need more help due to problems with thinking and movement. In the later stages of the disease, they often cannot care for themselves.\\nHow is Lewy body dementia (LBD) diagnosed?\\nThere isn't one test that can diagnose LBD. It is important to see an experienced doctor to get a diagnosis. This would usually be specialist such as a neurologist. The doctor will:\\nDo a medical history, including taking a detailed account of the symptoms. The doctor will talk to both the patient and caregivers.\\nDo physical and neurological exams\\nDo tests to rule out other conditions that could cause similar symptoms. These could include blood tests and brain imaging tests.\\nDo neuropsychological tests to evaluate memory and other cognitive functions\\n\\nLBD can be hard to diagnose, because Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease cause similar symptoms. Scientists think that Lewy body disease might be related to these diseases, or that they sometimes happen together.\\nIt's also important to know which type of LBD a person has, so the doctor can treat that type's particular symptoms. It also helps the doctor understand how the disease will affect the person over time. The doctor makes a diagnosis based on when certain symptoms start:\\nIf cognitive symptoms start within a year of movement problems, the diagnosis is dementia with Lewy bodies\\nIf cognitive problems start more than a year after the movement problems, the diagnosis is Parkinson's disease dementia\\n\\nWhat are the treatments for Lewy body dementia (LBD)?\\nThere is no cure for LBD, but treatments can help with the symptoms:\\nMedicines may help with some of the cognitive, movement, and psychiatric symptoms\\nPhysical therapy can help with movement problems\\nOccupational therapy may help find ways to more easily do everyday activities\\nSpeech therapy may help with swallowing difficulties and trouble speaking loudly and clearly\\nMental health counseling can help people with LBD and their families learn how to manage difficult emotions and behaviors. It can also help them plan for the future.\\nMusic or art therapy may reduce anxiety and improve well-being\\n\\nSupport groups can also be helpful for people with LBD and their caregivers. Support groups can give emotional and social support. They are also a place where people can share tips about how to deal with day-to-day challenges.\\nNIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke\\n\",\n",

They also reduce the risk of spreading the virus to others.\\nHow do HIV/AIDS medicines work?\\nHIV/AIDS medicines reduce the amount of HIV (viral load) in your body, which helps by:\\nGiving your immune system a chance to recover. Even though there is still some HIV in your body, your immune system should be strong enough to fight off infections and certain HIV-related cancers.\\nReducing the risk that you will spread HIV to others\\n\\nWhat are the types of HIV/AIDS medicines?\\nThere are several different types of HIV/AIDS medicines. Some work by blocking or changing enzymes that HIV needs to make copies of itself. This prevents HIV from copying itself, which reduces the amount of HIV in the body. Several medicines do this:\\nNucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) block an enzyme called reverse transcriptase\\nNon-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) bind to and later change reverse transcriptase\\nIntegrase inhibitors block an enzyme called integrase\\nProtease inhibitors (PIs) block an enzyme called protease\\n\\nSome HIV/AIDS medicines interfere with HIV's ability to infect CD4 immune system cells:\\nFusion inhibitors block HIV from entering the cells\\nCCR5 antagonists and post-attachment inhibitors block different molecules on the CD4 cells. To infect a cell, HIV has to bind to two types of molecules on the cell's surface. Blocking either of these molecules prevents HIV from entering the cells.\\nAttachment inhibitors bind to a specific protein on the outer surface of HIV. This prevents HIV from entering the cell.\\n\\nIn some cases, people take more than one medicine:\\nPharmacokinetic enhancers boost the effectiveness of certain HIV/AIDS medicines. A pharmacokinetic enhancer slows the breakdown of the other medicine. This allows that medicine to stay in the body longer at a higher concentration.\\nMultidrug combinations include a combination of two or more different HIV/AIDS medicines\\n\\nWhen do I need to start taking HIV/AIDS medicines?\\nIt's important to start taking HIV/AIDS medicines as soon as possible after your diagnosis, especially if you:\\nAre pregnant\\nHave AIDS\\nHave certain HIV-related illnesses and infections\\nHave an early HIV infection (the first 6 months after infection with HIV)\\n\\nWhat else do I need to know about taking HIV/AIDS medicines?\\nIt's important to take your medicines every day, according to the instructions from your health care provider. If you miss doses or don't follow a regular schedule, your treatment may not work, and the HIV virus may become resistant to the medicines.\\nHIV medicines can cause side effects. Most of these side effects are manageable, but a few can be serious. Tell your health care provider about any side effects that you are having. Don't stop taking your medicine without first talking to your provider. He or she may give you tips on how to deal with the side effects. In some cases, your provider may decide to change your medicines.\\nWhat are HIV PrEP and PEP medicines?\\nHIV medicines are not just used for treatment. Some people take them to prevent HIV. PrEP (pre-exposure prophylaxis) is for people who don't already have HIV but are at very high risk of getting it. PEP (post-exposure prophylaxis) is for people who have possibly been exposed to HIV.\\nNIH: Office of AIDS Research\\n\",\n",

       " 'Growth Disorders': '\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nDoes your child seem much shorter - or much taller - than other kids his or her age? It could be normal. Some children may be small for their age but still be developing normally. Some children are short or tall because their parents are.\\nBut some children have growth disorders.  Growth disorders are problems that prevent children from developing normal height, weight, sexual maturity or other features.\\nVery slow or very fast growth can sometimes signal a gland problem or disease.\\nThe pituitary gland makes growth hormone, which stimulates the growth of bone and other tissues. Children who have too little of it may be very short. Treatment with growth hormone can stimulate growth.\\nPeople can also have too much growth hormone.  Usually the cause is a pituitary gland tumor, which is not cancer.  Too much growth hormone can cause gigantism in children, where their bones and their body grow too much.  In adults, it can cause acromegaly, which makes the hands, feet and face larger than normal. Possible treatments include surgery to remove the tumor, medicines, and radiation therapy.\\n',\n",

Usually bird flu viruses only infect other birds. It is rare for people to get infected with bird flu viruses, but it can happen. Two types, H5N1 and H7N9, have infected some people during outbreaks in Asia, Africa, the Pacific, the Middle East, and parts of Europe. There have also been some rare cases of other types of bird flu affecting people in the United States.\\nMost of the people who get bird flu have had close contact with infected birds or with surfaces that have been contaminated by the birds' saliva, mucous, or droppings. It is also possible to get it by breathing in droplets or dust that contain the virus. Rarely, the virus has spread from one person to another. It may also be possible to catch bird flu by eating poultry or eggs that are not well cooked.\\nBird flu illness in people can range from mild to severe. Often, the symptoms are similar to the seasonal flu, such as:\\nFever\\nCough\\nSore throat\\nRunny or stuffy nose\\nMuscle or body aches\\nFatigue\\nHeadaches\\nEye redness (or conjunctivitis)\\nDifficulty breathing\\n\\nIn some cases, bird flu can cause serious complications and death.

       " 'Childhood Leukemia': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nWhat is leukemia?\\nLeukemia is a term for cancers of the blood cells. Leukemia starts in blood-forming tissues such as the bone marrow. Your bone marrow makes the cells which will develop into white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. Each type of cell has a different job:\\nWhite blood cells help your body fight infection\\nRed blood cells deliver oxygen from your lungs to your tissues and organs\\nPlatelets help form clots to stop bleeding\\n\\nWhen you have leukemia, your bone marrow makes large numbers of abnormal cells. This problem most often happens with white blood cells. These abnormal cells build up in your bone marrow and blood. They crowd out the healthy blood cells and make it hard for your cells and blood to do their work.\\nWhat are the types of leukemia in children?\\nThere are different types of leukemia. Some types are acute (fast growing). They usually get worse quickly if they are not treated. Most childhood leukemias are acute:\\nAcute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), which is the most common type of leukemia in children and the most common cancer in children. In ALL, the bone marrow makes too many lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell.\\nAcute myeloid leukemia (AML), which happens when bone marrow makes abnormal myeloblasts (a type of white blood cell), red blood cells, or platelets.\\n\\nOther types of leukemia are chronic (slow growing). They usually get worse over a longer period of time. They are rare in children:\\nChronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), in which the bone marrow makes abnormal lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell). It is more common in teens than children.\\nChronic myeloid leukemia (CML), in which the bone marrow makes abnormal granulocytes (a type of white blood cell). It is very rare in children.\\n\\nThere are some other rare types of leukemia in children, including juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML).\\nWhat causes leukemia in children?\\nLeukemia happens when there are changes in the genetic material (DNA) in bone marrow cells. The cause of these genetic changes is unknown. However, there are certain factors that raise the risk of childhood leukemia.\\nWho is at risk for leukemia in children?\\nThe factors that raise the risk of childhood leukemia include:\\nHaving a brother or sister, especially a twin, with leukemia\\nPast treatment with chemotherapy\\nExposure to radiation, including radiation therapy\\nHaving certain genetic conditions, such as \\n\\t\\nAtaxia telangiectasia\\nDown syndrome\\nFanconi anemia\\nLi-Fraumeni syndrome\\nNeurofibromatosis type 1\\n\\n\\n\\nThere are other factors that may raise the risk of getting one or more of the specific types of childhood leukemia.\\nWhat are the symptoms of leukemia in children?\\nSome of the symptoms of leukemia may include:\\nFeeling tired\\nFever or night sweats\\nEasy bruising or bleeding\\nWeight loss or loss of appetite\\nPetechiae, which are tiny red dots under the skin. They are caused by bleeding.\\n\\nOther leukemia symptoms can be different from type to type. Chronic leukemia may not cause symptoms at first.\\nHow is leukemia in children diagnosed?\\nYour health care provider may use many tools to diagnose leukemia:\\nA physical exam\\nA medical history\\nBlood tests, such as a complete blood count (CBC)\\nBone marrow tests. There are two main types - bone marrow aspiration and bone marrow biopsy. Both tests involve removing a sample of bone marrow and bone. The samples are sent to a lab for testing.\\nGenetic tests to look for gene and chromosome changes\\n\\nOnce there is a diagnosis of leukemia, other tests may be done to see whether the cancer has spread. These include imaging tests and a lumbar puncture, which is a procedure to collect and test cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).\\nWhat are the treatments for leukemia in children?\\nThe treatments for leukemia depend on which type it is, how severe the leukemia is, the child's age, and other factors. Possible treatments might include:\\nchemotherapy\\nradiation therapy\\nChemotherapy with stem cell transplant\\nTargeted therapy, which uses drugs or other substances that attack specific cancer cells with less harm to normal cells\\n\\nTreatment for childhood leukemia is often successful.

       " 'Surgery': '\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nThere are many reasons to have surgery. Some operations can relieve or prevent pain. Others can reduce a symptom of a problem or improve some body function. Some surgeries are done to find a problem. For example, a surgeon may do a biopsy, which involves removing a piece of tissue to examine under a microscope. Some surgeries, like heart surgery, can save your life.\\nSome operations that once needed large incisions (cuts in the body) can now be done using much smaller cuts. This is called laparoscopic surgery. Surgeons insert a thin tube with a camera to see, and use small tools to do the surgery.\\nAfter surgery there can be a risk of complications, including infection, too much bleeding, reaction to anesthesia, or accidental injury. There is almost always some pain with surgery.\\nAgency for Healthcare Research and Quality\\n',\n",
       " 'Rehabilitation': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nWhat is rehabilitation?\\nRehabilitation is care that can help you get back, keep, or improve abilities that you need for daily life. These abilities may be physical, mental, and/or cognitive (thinking and learning). You may have lost them because of a disease or injury, or as a side effect from a medical treatment. Rehabilitation can improve your daily life and functioning.\\nWho needs rehabilitation?\\nRehabilitation is for people who have lost abilities that they need for daily life. Some of the most common causes include:\\nInjuries and trauma, including burns, fractures (broken bones), traumatic brain injury, and spinal cord injuries\\nStroke\\nSevere infections\\nMajor surgery\\nSide effects from medical treatments, such as from cancer treatments\\nCertain birth defects and genetic disorders\\nDevelopmental disabilities\\nChronic pain, including back and neck pain\\n\\nWhat are the goals of rehabilitation?\\nThe overall goal of rehabilitation is to help you get your abilities back and regain independence. But the specific goals are different for each person. They depend on what caused the problem, whether the cause is ongoing or temporary, which abilities you lost, and how severe the problem is. For example,:\\nA person who has had a stroke may need rehabilitation to be able to dress or bathe without help\\nAn active person who has had a heart attack may go through cardiac rehabilitation to try to return to exercising\\nSomeone with a lung disease may get pulmonary rehabilitation to be able to breathe better and improve their quality of life\\n\\nWhat happens in a rehabilitation program?\\nWhen you get rehabilitation, you often have a team of different health care providers helping you. They will work with you to figure out your needs, goals, and treatment plan. The types of treatments that may be in a treatment plan include:\\nAssistive devices, which are tools, equipment, and products that help people with disabilities move and function\\nCognitive rehabilitation therapy to help you relearn or improve skills such as thinking, learning, memory, planning, and decision making\\nMental health counseling\\nMusic or art therapy to help you express your feelings, improve your thinking, and develop social connections\\nNutritional counseling\\nOccupational therapy to help you with your daily activities\\nPhysical therapy to help your strength, mobility, and fitness\\nRecreational therapy to improve your emotional well-being through arts and crafts, games, relaxation training, and animal-assisted therapy\\nSpeech-language therapy to help with speaking, understanding, reading, writing and swallowing\\nTreatment for pain\\nVocational rehabilitation to help you build skills for going to school or working at a job\\n\\nDepending on your needs, you may have rehabilitation in the providers' offices, a hospital, or an inpatient rehabilitation center.

       " 'Drug Use and Addiction': '\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nWhat are drugs?\\nDrugs are chemical substances that can change how your body and mind work. They include prescription medicines, over-the-counter medicines, alcohol, tobacco, and illegal drugs.\\nWhat is drug use?\\nDrug use, or misuse, includes:\\nUsing illegal substances, such as\\n\\nAnabolic steroids\\nClub drugs\\nCocaine\\nHeroin\\nInhalants\\nMarijuana\\nMethamphetamines\\n\\nMisusing prescription medicines, including opioids. This means taking the medicines in a different way than the health care provider prescribed. This includes\\n\\nTaking a medicine that was prescribed for someone else\\nTaking a larger dose than you are supposed to\\nUsing the medicine in a different way than you are supposed to. For example, instead of swallowing your tablets, you might crush and then snort or inject them.\\nUsing the medicine for another purpose, such as getting high\\n\\nMisusing over-the-counter medicines, including using them for another purpose and using them in a different way than you are supposed to\\n\\nDrug use is dangerous. It can harm your brain and body, sometimes permanently. It can hurt the people around you, including friends, families, kids, and unborn babies. Drug use can also lead to addiction.\\nWhat is drug addiction?\\nDrug addiction is a chronic brain disease. It causes a person to take drugs repeatedly, despite the harm they cause. Repeated drug use can change the brain and lead to addiction.\\nThe brain changes from addiction can be lasting, so drug addiction is considered a \"relapsing\" disease. This means that people in recovery are at risk for taking drugs again, even after years of not taking them.\\nDoes everyone who takes drugs become addicted?\\nNot everyone who uses drugs becomes addicted. Everyone\\'s bodies and brains are different, so their reactions to drugs can also be different. Some people may become addicted quickly, or it may happen over time. Other people never become addicted. Whether or not someone becomes addicted depends on many factors. They include genetic, environmental, and developmental factors.\\nWho is at risk for drug addiction?\\nVarious risk factors can make you more likely to become addicted to drugs, including:\\nYour biology. People can react to drugs differently. Some people like the feeling the first time they try a drug and want more. Others hate how it feels and never try it again.\\nMental health problems. People who have untreated mental health problems, such as depression, anxiety, or attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are more likely to become addicted. This can happen because drug use and mental health problems affect the same parts of the brain. Also, people with these problems may use drugs to try to feel better.\\nTrouble at home. If your home is an unhappy place or was when you were growing up, you might be more likely to have a drug problem.\\nTrouble in school, at work, or with making friends. You might use drugs to get your mind off these problems.\\nHanging around other people who use drugs. They might encourage you to try drugs.\\nStarting drug use when you\\'re young. When kids use drugs, it affects how their bodies and brains finish growing. This increases your chances of becoming addicted when you\\'re an adult.\\n\\nWhat are the signs that someone has a drug problem?\\nSigns that someone has a drug problem include:\\nChanging friends a lot\\nSpending a lot of time alone\\nLosing interest in favorite things\\nNot taking care of themselves - for example, not taking showers, changing clothes, or brushing their teeth\\nBeing really tired and sad\\nEating more or eating less than usual\\nBeing very energetic, talking fast, or saying things that don\\'t make sense\\nBeing in a bad mood\\nQuickly changing between feeling bad and feeling good\\nSleeping at strange hours\\nMissing important appointments\\nHaving problems at work or at school\\nHaving problems in personal or family relationships\\n\\nWhat are the treatments for drug addiction?\\nTreatments for drug addiction include counseling, medicines, or both. Research shows that combining medicines with counseling gives most people the best chance of success.\\nThe counseling may be individual, family, and/or group therapy. It can help you:\\nUnderstand why you got addicted\\nSee how drugs changed your behavior\\nLearn how to deal with your problems so you won\\'t go back to using drugs\\nLearn to avoid places, people, and situations where you might be tempted to use drugs\\n\\nMedicines can help with the symptoms of withdrawal. For addiction to certain drugs, there are also medicines that can help you re-establish normal brain function and decrease your cravings.\\nIf you have a mental disorder along with an addiction, it is known as a dual diagnosis. It is important to treat both problems. This will increase your chance of success.\\nIf you have a severe addiction, you may need hospital-based or residential treatment. Residential treatment programs combine housing and treatment services.\\nCan drug use and addiction be prevented?\\nDrug use and addiction are preventable. Prevention programs involving families, schools, communities, and the media may prevent or reduce drug use and addiction. These programs include education and outreach to help people understand the risks of drug use.\\nNIH: National Institute on Drug Abuse\\n',\n",
       " 'Cancer in Children': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nCancer is a group of related diseases. In all types of cancer, some of the body's cells begin to divide without stopping and spread into surrounding tissues.\\nNormally, new cells form as you need them, replacing old cells that die. Sometimes, this process goes wrong. New cells form when you don't need them, and old cells don't die when they should. The extra cells can form a tumor. Tumors can be benign or malignant. Benign tumors aren't cancer while malignant ones are. Cells from malignant tumors can invade nearby tissues. They can also break away and spread to other parts of the body.\\nChildren can get cancer in the same parts of the body as adults, but there are differences. Childhood cancers can occur suddenly, without early symptoms, and have a high rate of cure. The most common children's cancer is leukemia. Other cancers that affect children include brain tumors, lymphoma, and soft tissue sarcoma.\\nSymptoms and treatment depend on the type of cancer and how advanced it is. Treatments may include:\\n\\nSurgery\\nRadiation therapy\\nChemotherapy\\nStem cell transplants\\nTargeted therapy, which uses drugs or other substances that attack specific cancer cells with less harm to normal cells\\n\\nNIH: National Cancer Institute\\n\",\n",

       " 'Appendicitis': '\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nThe appendix is a small, tube-like organ attached to the first part of the large intestine. It is located in the lower right part of the abdomen. It has no known function. A blockage inside of the appendix causes appendicitis. The blockage leads to increased pressure, problems with blood flow, and inflammation. If the blockage is not treated, the appendix can burst and spread infection into the abdomen. This causes a condition called peritonitis.\\nThe main symptom is pain in the abdomen, often on the right side.  It is usually sudden and gets worse over time.  Other symptoms may include:\\n\\tSwelling in the abdomen\\n\\tLoss of appetite\\n\\tNausea and vomiting\\n\\tConstipation or diarrhea\\n\\tInability to pass gas\\n\\tLow fever \\n\\nNot everyone with appendicitis has all these symptoms.\\nAppendicitis is a medical emergency.

Three out of four children will have at least one ear infection by their third birthday.  Adults can also get ear infections, but they are less common.\\nThe infection usually affects the middle ear and is called otitis media. The tubes inside the ears become clogged with fluid and mucus. This can affect hearing, because sound cannot get through all that fluid.\\nIf your child isn\\'t old enough to say \"My ear hurts,\" here are a few things to look for:\\nTugging at ears\\nCrying more than usual\\nFluid draining from the ear\\nTrouble sleeping\\nBalance difficulties\\nHearing problems\\n\\nYour health care provider will diagnose an ear infection by looking inside the ear with an instrument called an otoscope.\\nOften, ear infections go away on their own. Your health care provider may recommend pain relievers. Severe infections and infections in young babies may require antibiotics. \\nChildren who get infections often may need surgery to place small tubes inside their ears.

       " 'Radiation Exposure': '\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nWhat is radiation?\\nRadiation is energy. It travels in the form of energy waves or high-speed particles. Radiation can occur naturally or be man-made. There are two types:\\nNon-ionizing radiation, which includes radio waves, cell phones, microwaves, infrared radiation and visible light\\nIonizing radiation, which includes ultraviolet radiation, radon, x-rays, and gamma rays\\n\\nWhat are the sources of radiation exposure?\\nBackground radiation is all around us all the time. Most of it forms naturally from minerals. These radioactive minerals are in the ground, soil, water, and even our bodies. Background radiation can also come from outer space and the sun. Other sources are man-made, such as x-rays, radiation therapy to treat cancer, and electrical power lines.\\nWhat are the health effects of radiation exposure?\\nRadiation has been around us throughout our evolution. So our bodies are designed to deal with the low levels we\\'re exposed to every day. But too much radiation can damage tissues by changing cell structure and damaging DNA. This can cause serious health problems, including cancer.\\nThe amount of damage that exposure to radiation can cause depends on several factors, including:\\nThe type of radiation\\nThe dose (amount) of radiation\\nHow you were exposed, such as through skin contact, swallowing or breathing it in, or having rays pass through your body\\nWhere the radiation concentrates in the body and how long it stays there\\nHow sensitive your body is to radiation. A fetus is most vulnerable to the effects of radiation. Infants, children, older adults, pregnant women, and people with compromised immune systems are more vulnerable to health effects than healthy adults.\\n\\nBeing exposed to a lot of radiation over a short period of time, such as from a radiation emergency, can cause skin burns. It may also lead to acute radiation syndrome (ARS, or \"radiation sickness\").  The symptoms of ARS include headache and diarrhea. They usually start within hours. Those symptoms will go away and the person will seem healthy for a little while. But then they will get sick again. How soon they get sick again, which symptoms they have, and how sick they get depends on the amount of radiation they received. In some cases, ARS causes death in the following days or weeks.\\nExposure to low levels of radiation in the environment does not cause immediate health effects. But it can slightly increase your overall risk of cancer.\\nWhat are the treatments for acute radiation sickness?\\nBefore they start treatment, health care professionals need to figure out how much radiation your body absorbed. They will ask about your symptoms, do blood tests, and may use a device that measures radiation. They also try get more information about the exposure, such as what type of radiation it was, how far away you were from the source of the radiation, and how long you were exposed.\\nTreatment focuses on reducing and treating infections, preventing dehydration, and treating injuries and burns. Some people may need treatments that help the bone marrow recover its function. If you were exposed to certain types of radiation, your provider may give you a treatment that limits or removes the contamination that is inside your body. You may also get treatments for your symptoms.\\nHow can radiation exposure be prevented?\\nThere are steps you can take to prevent or reduce radiation exposure:\\nIf your health care provider recommends a test that uses radiation, ask about its risks and benefits. In some cases, you may be able to have a different test that does not use radiation. But if you do need a test that uses radiation, do some research into the local imaging facilities. Find one that monitors and uses techniques to reduce the doses they are giving patients.\\nReduce electromagnetic radiation exposure from your cell phone. At this time, scientific evidence has not found a link between cell phone use and health problems in humans. More research is needed to be sure. But if you still have concerns, you can reduce how much time you spend on your phone. You can also use speaker mode or a headset to place more distance between your head and the cell phone.\\nIf you live in a house, test the radon levels, and if you need to, get a radon reduction system.\\nDuring a radiation emergency, get inside a building to take shelter. Stay inside, with all of the windows and doors shut. Stay tuned to and follow the advice of emergency responders and officials.\\n\\nEnvironmental Protection Agency\\n',\n",
       " 'Parathyroid Disorders': '\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nMost people have four pea-sized glands, called parathyroid glands, on the thyroid gland in the neck. Though their names are similar, the thyroid and parathyroid glands are completely different. The parathyroid glands make parathyroid hormone (PTH), which helps your body keep the right balance of calcium and phosphorous.\\nIf your parathyroid glands make too much or too little hormone, it disrupts this balance. If they secrete extra PTH, you have hyperparathyroidism, and your blood calcium rises. In many cases, a benign tumor on a parathyroid gland makes it overactive. Or, the extra hormones can come from enlarged parathyroid glands. Very rarely, the cause is cancer.\\nIf you do not have enough PTH, you have hypoparathyroidism. Your blood will have too little calcium and too much phosphorous. Causes include injury to the glands, endocrine disorders, or genetic conditions. Treatment is aimed at restoring the balance of calcium and phosphorous.\\nNIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases\\n',\n",
       " 'Pink Eye': '\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nConjunctivitis is the medical name for pink eye. It involves inflammation of the outer layer of the eye and inside of the eyelid. It can cause swelling, itching, burning, discharge, and redness. Causes include:\\nBacterial or viral infection\\nAllergies \\nSubstances that cause irritation\\nContact lens products, eye drops, or eye ointments\\n\\nPink eye usually does not affect vision. Infectious pink eye can easily spread from one person to another. The infection will clear in most cases without medical care, but bacterial pink eye needs treatment with antibiotic eye drops or ointment.\\nNIH: National Eye Institute\\n',\n",
       " 'Bursitis': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nA bursa is a small, fluid-filled sac that acts as a cushion between a bone and other moving parts, such as muscles, tendons, or skin. Bursitis occurs when a bursa becomes inflamed. People get bursitis by overusing a joint. It can also be caused by an injury. It usually occurs at the knee or elbow. Kneeling or leaning your elbows on a hard surface for a long time can make bursitis start. Doing the same kinds of movements every day or putting stress on joints increases your risk.\\nSymptoms of bursitis include pain and swelling. Your doctor will diagnose bursitis with a physical exam and tests such as x-rays and MRIs. He or she may also take fluid from the swollen area to be sure the problem isn't an infection.\\nTreatment of bursitis includes rest, pain medicines, or ice. If there is no improvement, your doctor may inject a drug into the area around the swollen bursa. If the joint still does not improve after 6 to 12 months, you may need surgery to repair damage and relieve pressure on the bursa.\\nNIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases\\n\",\n",
       " 'Diagnostic Imaging': '\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nDiagnostic imaging lets doctors look inside your body for clues about a medical condition. A variety of machines and techniques can create pictures of the structures and activities inside your body. The type of imaging your doctor uses depends on your symptoms and the part of your body being examined. They include:\\nX-rays\\nCT scans\\nNuclear medicine scans\\nMRI scans\\nUltrasound\\n\\nMany imaging tests are painless and easy. Some require you to stay still for a long time inside a machine. This can be uncomfortable. Certain tests involve exposure to a small amount of radiation.\\nFor some imaging tests, doctors insert a tiny camera attached to a long, thin tube into your body. This tool is called a scope. The doctor moves it through a body passageway or opening to see inside a particular organ, such as your heart, lungs, or colon. These procedures often require anesthesia.\\n',\n",

It is common in warm, wet areas of the world. Outbreaks occur in the rainy season. Dengue is rare in the United States. \\nSymptoms include a high fever, headaches, joint and muscle pain, vomiting, and a rash. In some cases, dengue turns into dengue hemorrhagic fever, which causes bleeding from your nose, gums, or under your skin. It can also become dengue shock syndrome, which causes massive bleeding and shock. These forms of dengue are life-threatening.\\nThere is no specific treatment. Most people with dengue recover within 2 weeks. Until then, drinking lots of fluids, resting and taking non-aspirin fever-reducing medicines might help. People with the more severe forms of dengue usually need to go to the hospital and get fluids.\\nTo lower your risk when traveling to areas where dengue is found:\\nWear insect repellent with DEET \\nWear clothes that cover your arms, legs and feet \\nClose unscreened doors and windows  \\n\\n\\n',\n",

       " 'Tumors and Pregnancy': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nTumors during pregnancy are rare, but they can happen. Tumors can be either benign or malignant. Benign tumors aren't cancer. Malignant ones are. The most common cancers in pregnancy are breast cancer, cervical cancer, lymphoma, and melanoma.  Cancer itself rarely harms the baby, and some cancer treatments are safe during pregnancy.  You and your health care provider will work together to find the best treatment.  Your options will depend on how far along the pregnancy is, as well as the type, size, and stage of your cancer.\\nAnother type of tumor that women can get is called a gestational trophoblastic disease (GTD). It happens when a fertilized egg doesn't become a fetus.  GTD is not always easy to find.  It is usually benign, but some types can be malignant. The most common type of GTD is a molar pregnancy. In its early stages, it may look like a normal pregnancy. You should see your health care provider if you have vaginal bleeding (not menstrual bleeding). \\nTreatment depends on the type of tumor, whether it has spread to other places, and your overall health.\\n\",\n",
       " 'After Surgery': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nAfter any operation, you'll have some side effects. There is usually some pain with surgery. There may also be swelling and soreness around the area that the surgeon cut.   Your surgeon can tell you which side effects to expect.\\nThere can also be complications. These are unplanned events linked to the operation. Some complications are infection, too much bleeding, reaction to anesthesia, or accidental injury. Some people have a greater risk of complications because of other medical conditions.\\nYour surgeon can tell you how you might feel and what you will be able to do - or not do - the first few days, weeks, or months after surgery. Some other questions to ask are:\\nHow long you will be in the hospital\\nWhat kind of supplies, equipment, and help you might need when you go home\\nWhen you can go back to work\\nWhen it is ok to start exercising again\\nAre they any other restrictions in your activities\\n\\nFollowing your surgeon's advice can help you recover as soon as possible.\\nAgency for Healthcare Research and Quality\\n\",\n",

Two of them cause most of the strep infections in people: group A and group B.\\nGroup A strep causes:\\nStrep throat - a sore, red throat. Your tonsils may be swollen and have white spots on them.\\nScarlet fever - an illness that follows strep throat. It causes a red rash on the body.\\nImpetigo - a skin infection\\nToxic shock syndrome\\nCellulitis and necrotizing fasciitis (flesh-eating disease)\\n\\nGroup B strep can cause blood infections, pneumonia and meningitis in newborns. A screening test during pregnancy can tell if you have it. If you do, intravenous (IV) antibiotics during labor can save your baby's life.  Adults can also get group B strep infections, especially if they are 65 or older or already have health problems. Strep B can cause urinary tract infections, blood infections, skin infections and pneumonia in adults.\\nAntibiotics are used to treat strep infections.\\n\\n\",\n",

       " 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes': '\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nYour bone marrow is the spongy tissue inside some of your bones, such as your hip and thigh bones. It contains immature cells, called stem cells. The stem cells can develop into the red blood cells that carry oxygen through your body, the white blood cells that fight infections, and the platelets that help with blood clotting. If you have a myelodysplastic syndrome, the stem cells do not mature into healthy blood cells. Many of them die in the bone marrow.  This means that you do not have enough healthy cells, which can lead to infection, anemia, or easy bleeding.\\nMyelodysplastic syndromes often do not cause early symptoms and are sometimes found during a routine blood test.  If you have symptoms, they may include:\\nShortness of breath\\nWeakness or feeling tired\\nSkin that is paler than usual\\nEasy bruising or bleeding\\nPinpoint spots under the skin caused by bleeding\\nFever or frequent infections\\n\\nMyelodysplastic syndromes are rare. People at higher risk are over 60, have had chemotherapy or radiation therapy, or have been exposed to certain chemicals.  Treatment options include transfusions, drug therapy, chemotherapy, and blood or bone marrow stem cell transplants.\\nNIH: National Cancer Institute\\n',\n",
       " 'Adhesions': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nAdhesions are bands of scar-like tissue. Normally, internal tissues and organs have slippery surfaces so they can shift easily as the body moves. Adhesions cause tissues and organs to stick together. They might connect the loops of the intestines to each other, to nearby organs, or to the wall of the abdomen. They can pull sections of the intestines out of place. This may block food from passing through the intestine.\\nAdhesions can occur anywhere in the body. But they often form after surgery on the abdomen. Almost everyone who has surgery on the abdomen gets adhesions. Some adhesions don't cause any problems. But when they partly or completely block the intestines, they cause symptoms such as:\\nSevere abdominal pain or cramping\\nVomiting\\nBloating\\nAn inability to pass gas\\nConstipation\\n\\nAdhesions can sometimes cause infertility in women by preventing fertilized eggs from reaching the uterus.\\nNo tests are available to detect adhesions.  Doctors usually find them during surgery to diagnose other problems.\\nSome adhesions go away by themselves. If they partly block your intestines, a diet low in fiber can allow food to move easily through the affected area. If you have a complete intestinal obstruction, it is life-threatening. You should get immediate medical attention and may need surgery. \\nNIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases\\n\",\n",

       " 'Acute Flaccid Myelitis': '\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nWhat is acute flaccid myelitis (AFM)?\\nAcute flaccid myelitis (AFM) is a neurologic disease. It is rare, but serious. It affects an area of the spinal cord called gray matter. This can cause the muscles and reflexes in the body to become weak.\\nBecause of these symptoms, some people call AFM a \"polio-like\" illness. But since 2014, people with AFM have been tested, and they did not have poliovirus.\\nWhat causes acute flaccid myelitis (AFM)?\\nResearchers think that viruses, including enteroviruses, likely play a role in causing AFM.  Most people with AFM had a mild respiratory illness or fever (like you would get from a viral infection) before they got AFM.\\nWho is at risk for acute flaccid myelitis (AFM)?\\nAnyone can get AFM, but most cases (more than 90%) have been in young children.\\nWhat are the symptoms of acute flaccid myelitis (AFM)?\\nMost people with AFM will suddenly have:\\nArm or leg weakness\\nA loss of muscle tone and reflexes\\n\\nSome people also have other symptoms, including:\\nFacial drooping/weakness\\nTrouble moving the eyes\\nDrooping eyelids\\nTrouble swallowing\\nSlurred speech\\nPain in the arms, legs, back, or neck\\n\\nSometimes AFM can weaken the muscles that you need for breathing. This can lead to respiratory failure, which is very serious. If you get respiratory failure, you may need to use a ventilator (breathing machine) to help you breathe.\\nIf you or your child develops any of these symptoms, you should get medical care right away.\\nHow is acute flaccid myelitis (AFM) diagnosed?\\nAFM causes many of the same symptoms as other neurologic diseases, such as transverse myelitis and Guillain-Barre syndrome. This can make it difficult to diagnose. The doctor may use many tools to make a diagnosis:\\nA neurologic exam, including looking at where there is weakness, poor muscle tone, and decreased reflexes\\nAn MRI to look at the spinal cord and brain\\nLab tests on the cerebrospinal fluid (the fluid around the brain and spinal cord)\\nNerve conduction and electromyography (EMG) studies. These tests check nerve speed and the response of muscles to the messages from the nerves. \\n\\nIt is important that the tests are done as soon as possible after the symptoms start.\\nWhat are the treatments for acute flaccid myelitis (AFM)?\\nThere is no specific treatment for AFM. A doctor who specializes in treating brain and spinal cord illnesses (neurologist) may recommend treatments for specific symptoms. For example, physical and/or occupational therapy may help with arm or leg weakness. Researchers do not know the long-term outcomes of people with AFM.\\nCan acute flaccid myelitis (AFM) be prevented?\\nSince viruses likley play a role in AFM, you should take steps to help prevent getting or spreading viral infections by:\\nWashing hands often with soap and water\\nAvoiding touching your face with unwashed hands\\nAvoiding close contact with people who are sick\\nCleaning and disinfecting surfaces that you frequently touch, including toys\\nCovering coughs and sneezes with a tissue or upper shirt sleeve, not hands\\nStaying home when sick\\n\\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention\\n',\n",
       " 'Cervical Cancer Screening': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nThe cervix is the lower part of the uterus, the place where a baby grows during pregnancy.  Cancer screening is looking for cancer before you have any symptoms. Cancer found early may be easier to treat.\\nCervical cancer screening is usually part of a woman's health checkup.  There are two types of tests: the Pap test and the HPV test.   For both, the doctor or nurse collects cells from the surface of the cervix.  With the Pap test, the lab checks the sample for cancer cells or abnormal cells that could become cancer later.  With the HPV test, the lab checks for HPV infection.  HPV is a virus that spreads through sexual contact.  It can sometimes lead to cancer.  If your screening tests are abnormal, your doctor may do more tests, such as a biopsy.\\nCervical cancer screening has risks.  The results can sometimes be wrong, and you may have unnecessary follow-up tests.  There are also benefits.  Screening has been shown to decrease the number of deaths from cervical cancer. You and your doctor should discuss your risk for cervical cancer, the pros and cons of the screening tests, at what age to start being screened, and how often to be screened.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Head Injuries': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nChances are you've bumped your head before.  Often, the injury is minor because your skull is hard and it protects your brain.  But other head injuries can be more severe, such as a skull fracture, concussion, or traumatic brain injury.\\nHead injuries can be open or closed.  A closed injury does not break through the skull.  With an open, or penetrating, injury, an object pierces the skull and enters the brain.  Closed injuries are not always less severe than open injuries.\\nSome common causes of head injuries are falls, motor vehicle accidents, violence, and sports injuries.\\nIt is important to know the warning signs of a moderate or severe head injury.  Get help immediately if the injured person has:\\nA headache that gets worse or does not go away\\nRepeated vomiting or nausea\\nConvulsions or seizures\\nAn inability to wake up\\nDilated (enlarged) pupil in one or both eyes\\nSlurred speech\\nWeakness or numbness in the arms or legs\\nLoss of coordination\\nIncreased confusion, restlessness, or agitation\\n\\nDoctors use a neurologic exam and imaging tests to make a diagnosis.

You can also get infected by coming in contact with an object, such as a toy, that has bacteria on it.\\nDiphtheria usually affects the nose and throat. Symptoms include:\\nSore throat\\nSwollen glands in the neck\\nFever\\nWeakness\\n\\nYour doctor will diagnose it based on your signs and symptoms and a lab test. Getting treatment for diphtheria quickly is important. If your doctor suspects that you have it, you'll start treatment before the lab tests come back. Treatment is with antibiotics.\\nThe diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus vaccine can prevent diphtheria, but its protection does not last forever.  Children need another dose, or booster, at about age 12.  Then, as adults, they should get a booster every 10 years. Diphtheria is very rare in the United States because of the vaccine.\\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention\\n\",\n",

They interfere with your life, but you cannot control or stop them.\\nWhat causes obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)?\\nThe cause of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is unknown. Factors such as genetics, brain biology and chemistry, and your environment may play a role.\\nWho is at risk for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)?\\nObsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) usually begins when you are a teen or young adult. Boys often develop OCD at a younger age than girls.\\nRisk factors for OCD include:\\nFamily history. People with a first-degree relative (such as a parent, sibling, or child) who has OCD are at higher risk. This is especially true if the relative developed OCD as a child or teen.\\nBrain structure and functioning. Imaging studies have shown that people with OCD have differences in certain parts of the brain. Researchers need to do more studies to understand the connection between the brain differences and OCD.\\nChildhood trauma, such as child abuse. Some studies have found a link between trauma in childhood and OCD. More research is needed to understand this relationship better.\\n\\nIn some cases, children may develop OCD or OCD symptoms following a streptococcal infection. This is called Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders Associated with Streptococcal Infections (PANDAS).\\nWhat are the symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)?\\nPeople with OCD may have symptoms of obsessions, compulsions, or both:\\nObsessions are repeated thoughts, urges, or mental images that cause anxiety. They may involve things such as\\n \\nFear of germs or contamination\\nFear of losing or misplacing something\\nWorries about harm coming towards yourself or others\\nUnwanted forbidden thoughts involving sex or religion\\nAggressive thoughts towards yourself or others\\nNeeding things lined up exactly or arranged in a particular, precise way\\n\\nCompulsions are behaviors that you feel like you need to do over and over to try to reduce your anxiety or stop the obsessive thoughts. Some common compulsions include\\n \\nExcessive cleaning and/or handwashing\\nRepeatedly checking on things, such as whether the door is locked or the oven is off\\nCompulsive counting\\nOrdering and arranging things in a particular, precise way\\n\\n\\nSome people with OCD also have a Tourette syndrome or another tic disorder. Tics are sudden twitches, movements, or sounds that people do repeatedly. People who have tics cannot stop their body from doing these things.\\nHow is obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) diagnosed?\\nThe first step is to talk with your health care provider about your symptoms. Your provider should do an exam and ask you about your medical history. He or she needs to make sure that a physical problem is not causing your symptoms. If it seems to be a mental problem, your provider may refer you to a mental health specialist for further evaluation or treatment.\\nObsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) can sometimes be hard to diagnose. Its symptoms are like those of other mental disorders, such as anxiety disorders. It is also possible to have both OCD and another mental disorder.\\nNot everyone who has obsessions or compulsions has OCD. Your symptoms would usually be considered OCD when you:\\nCan't control your thoughts or behaviors, even when you know that they are excessive\\nSpend at least 1 hour a day on these thoughts or behaviors\\nDon't get pleasure when performing the behaviors. But doing them may briefly give you relief from the anxiety that your thoughts cause.\\nHave significant problems in your daily life because of these thoughts or behaviors\\n\\nWhat are the treatments for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)?\\nThe main treatments for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) are cognitive behavioral therapy, medicines, or both:\\nCognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a type of psychotherapy. It teaches you different ways of thinking, behaving, and reacting to the obsessions and compulsions. One specific type of CBT that can treat OCD is called Exposure and Response Prevention (EX/RP). EX/RP involves gradually exposing you to your fears or obsessions. You learn healthy ways to deal with the anxiety they cause.\\nMedicines for OCD include certain types of antidepressants. If those don't work for you, your provider may suggest taking some other type of psychiatric medicine.\\n\\nNIH: National Institute of Mental Health \\n\",\n",

Men who have had a vasectomy should still practice safe sex to avoid STDs.\\nNIH: National Institute of Child Health and Human Development\\n',\n",
       " 'Obesity': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nObesity means having too much body fat. It is different from being overweight, which means weighing too much.  The weight may come from muscle, bone, fat, and/or body water.  Both terms mean that a person's weight is greater than what's considered healthy for his or her height. \\nObesity happens over time when you eat more calories than you use. The balance between calories-in and calories-out differs for each person. Factors that might affect your weight include your genetic makeup, overeating, eating high-fat foods, and not being physically active. \\nObesity increases your risk of diabetes, heart disease, stroke, arthritis, and some cancers. If you have obesity, losing even 5 to 10% of your weight can delay or prevent some of these diseases.

For example, you may have weakness in the muscles for eye movement, facial expressions, and swallowing. You can also have weakness in other muscles.  This weakness gets worse with activity, and better with rest.\\nMyasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disease. Your body's immune system makes antibodies that block or change some of the nerve signals to your muscles.  This makes your muscles weaker.\\nOther conditions can cause muscle weakness, so myasthenia gravis can be hard to diagnose. Tests used to make a diagnosis include blood, nerve, muscle, and imaging tests.\\nWith treatment, the muscle weakness often gets much better. Medicines can help improve nerve-to-muscle messages and make muscles stronger. Other drugs keep your body from making so many abnormal antibodies. These medicines can have major side effects, so they should be used carefully. There are also treatments which filter abnormal antibodies from the blood or add healthy antibodies from donated blood. Sometimes, surgery to take out the thymus gland helps.\\nSome people with myasthenia gravis go into remission. This means that they do not have symptoms.  The remission is usually temporary, but sometimes it can be permanent.\\nNIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke\\n\",\n",

       " 'Carotid Artery Disease': '\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nYour carotid arteries are two large blood vessels in your neck. They supply your brain and head with blood.  If you have carotid artery disease, the arteries become narrow or blocked, usually because of atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis is the buildup of plaque, which is made up of fat, cholesterol, calcium, and other substances found in the blood.\\nCarotid artery disease is serious because it can block the blood flow to your brain, causing a stroke. Too much plaque in the artery can cause a blockage. You can also have a blockage when a piece of plaque or a blood clot breaks off the wall of an artery. The plaque or clot can travel through the bloodstream and get stuck in one of your brain\\'s smaller arteries.\\nCarotid artery disease often does not cause symptoms until the blockage or narrowing is severe.  One sign may be a bruit (whooshing sound) that your doctor hears when listening to your artery with a stethoscope. Another sign is a transient ischemic attack (TIA), a \"mini-stroke.\" A TIA is like a stroke, but it only lasts a few minutes, and the symptoms usually go away within an hour. Stroke is another sign.\\nImaging tests can confirm whether you have carotid artery disease.\\nTreatments may include:\\nHealthy lifestyle changes\\nMedicines\\nCarotid endarterectomy, surgery to remove the plaque\\nAngioplasty, a procedure to place a balloon and stent into the artery to open it and hold it open\\n\\nNIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute\\n',\n",

       " 'Period Pain': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nWhat are painful periods?\\nMenstruation, or period, is normal vaginal bleeding that happens as part of a woman's monthly cycle. Many women have painful periods, also called dysmenorrhea. The pain is most often menstrual cramps, which are a throbbing, cramping pain in your lower abdomen. You may also have other symptoms, such as lower back pain, nausea, diarrhea, and headaches. Period pain is not the same as premenstrual syndrome (PMS). PMS causes many different symptoms, including weight gain, bloating, irritability, and fatigue. PMS often starts one to two weeks before your period starts.\\nWhat causes painful periods?\\nThere are two types of dysmenorrhea: primary and secondary. Each type has different causes.\\nPrimary dysmenorrhea is the most common kind of period pain. It is period pain that is not caused by another condition. The cause is usually having too many prostaglandins, which are chemicals that your uterus makes. These chemicals make the muscles of your uterus tighten and relax, and this causes the cramps.\\nThe pain can start a day or two before your period. It normally lasts for a few days, though in some women it can last longer.\\nYou usually first start having period pain when you are younger, just after you begin getting periods. Often, as you get older, you have less pain. The pain may also get better after you have given birth.\\nSecondary dysmenorrhea often starts later in life. It is caused by conditions that affect your uterus or other reproductive organs, such as endometriosis and uterine fibroids. This kind of pain often gets worse over time. It may begin before your period starts and continue after your period ends.\\nWhat can I do about period pain?\\nTo help ease your period pain, you can try:\\nUsing a heating pad or hot water bottle on your lower abdomen\\nGetting some exercise\\nTaking a hot bath\\nDoing relaxation techniques, including yoga and meditation\\n\\nYou might also try taking over-the-counter pain relievers such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). NSAIDs include ibuprofen and naproxen. Besides relieving pain, NSAIDs reduce the amount of prostaglandins that your uterus makes and lessen their effects.  This helps to lessen the cramps. You can take NSAIDs when you first have symptoms, or when your period starts. You can keep taking them for a few days. You should not take NSAIDS if you have ulcers or other stomach problems, bleeding problems, or liver disease. You should also not take them if you are allergic to aspirin. Always check with your health care provider if you are not sure whether or not you should take NSAIDs.\\nIt may also help to get enough rest and avoid using alcohol and tobacco.\\nWhen should I get medical help for my period pain?\\nFor many women, some pain during your period is normal. However, you should contact your health care provider if:\\nNSAIDs and self-care measures don't help, and the pain interferes with your life\\nYour cramps suddenly get worse\\nYou are over 25 and you get severe cramps for the first time\\nYou have a fever with your period pain\\nYou have the pain even when you are not getting your period\\n\\nHow is the cause of severe period pain diagnosed?\\nTo diagnose severe period pain, your health care provider will ask you about your medical history and do a pelvic exam. You may also have an ultrasound or other imaging test. If your health care provider thinks you have secondary dysmenorrhea, you might have laparoscopy. It is a surgery that that lets your health care provider look inside your body.\\nWhat are treatments for severe period pain?\\nIf your period pain is primary dysmenorrhea and you need medical treatment, your health care provider might suggest using hormonal birth control, such as the pill, patch, ring, or IUD. Another treatment option might be prescription pain relievers.\\nIf you have secondary dysmenorrhea, your treatment depends upon the condition that is causing the problem. In some cases, you may need surgery.\\n\",\n",

It has many benefits, including improving your overall health and fitness, and reducing your risk for many chronic diseases. There are many different types of exercise; it is important that you pick the right types for you. Most people benefit from a combination of them:\\nEndurance, or aerobic, activities increase your breathing and heart rate. They keep your heart, lungs, and circulatory system healthy and improve your overall fitness. Examples include brisk walking, jogging, swimming, and biking.\\nStrength, or resistance training, exercises make your muscles stronger. Some examples are lifting weights and using a resistance band.\\nBalance exercises can make it easier to walk on uneven surfaces and help prevent falls. To improve your balance, try tai chi or exercises like standing on one leg.\\nFlexibility exercises stretch your muscles and can help your body stay limber. Yoga and doing various stretches can make you more flexible.\\n\\nFitting regular exercise into your daily schedule may seem difficult at first. But you can start slowly, and break your exercise time into chunks. Even doing ten minutes at a time is fine. You can work your way up to doing the recommended amount of exercise. How much exercise you need depends on your age and health.\\nOther things that you can do to make the most of your workouts include:\\nChoosing activities that work all the different parts of the body, including your core (muscles around your back, abdomen, and pelvis). Good core strength improves balance and stability and helps to prevent lower back injury.\\nChoosing activities that you enjoy. It's easier to make exercise a regular part of your life if you have fun doing it.\\nExercising safely, with proper equipment, to prevent injuries. Also, listen to your body and don't overdo it.\\nGiving yourself goals. The goals should challenge you, but also be realistic. It's also helpful to reward yourself when you reach your goals.

You need a small amount of copper from food to stay healthy. Too much copper is poisonous.\\nNormally, your liver releases extra copper into bile, a digestive fluid.  With Wilson disease, the copper builds up in your liver, and it releases the copper directly into your bloodstream. This can cause damage to your brain, kidneys, and eyes.\\nWilson disease is present at birth, but symptoms usually start between ages 5 and 35. It first attacks the liver, the central nervous system or both. The most characteristic sign is a rusty brown ring around the cornea of the eye. A physical exam and laboratory tests can diagnose it.\\nTreatment is with drugs to remove the extra copper from your body.  You need to take medicine and follow a low-copper diet for the rest of your life. Don't eat shellfish or liver, as these foods may contain high levels of copper.  At the beginning of treatment, you'll also need to avoid chocolate, mushrooms, and nuts. Have your drinking water checked for copper content and don't take multivitamins that contain copper.\\nWith early detection and proper treatment, you can enjoy good health.\\nNIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases\\n\",\n",

But if you have too much in your blood, it can stick to the walls of your arteries and narrow or even block them. This puts you at risk for coronary artery disease and other heart diseases.\\nCholesterol travels through the blood on proteins called lipoproteins. One type, LDL, is sometimes called the \"bad\" cholesterol. A high LDL level leads to a buildup of cholesterol in your arteries. Another type, HDL, is sometimes called the \"good\" cholesterol. It carries cholesterol from other parts of your body back to your liver. Then your liver removes the cholesterol from your body.\\nWhat are the treatments for high cholesterol?\\nIf you have high cholesterol, lifestyle changes can help you to lower your cholesterol level. But sometimes the lifestyle changes are not enough, and you need to take cholesterol medicines. You should still continue with the lifestyle changes even though you are taking medicines.\\nWho needs cholesterol medicines?\\nYour health care provider may prescribe medicine if:\\nYou have already had a heart attack or stroke, or you have peripheral arterial disease\\nYour LDL (bad) cholesterol level is 190 mg/dL or higher\\nYou are 40-75 years old, you have diabetes, and your LDL cholesterol level is 70 mg/dL or higher\\nYou are 40-75 years old, you have a high risk of developing heart disease or stroke, and your LDL cholesterol level is 70 mg/dL or higher\\n\\nWhat are the different types of medicines for cholesterol?\\nThere are several types of cholesterol-lowering drugs available, including:\\nStatins, which block the liver from making cholesterol\\nBile acid sequestrants, which decrease the amount of fat absorbed from food\\nCholesterol absorption inhibitors, which decrease the amount of cholesterol absorbed from food and lower triglycerides.\\nNicotinic acid (niacin), which lowers LDL (bad) cholesterol and triglycerides and raises HDL (good) cholesterol.  Even though you can buy niacin without a prescription, you should talk to your health care provider before taking it to lower your cholesterol. High doses of niacin can cause serious side effects.\\nPCSK9 inhibitors, which block a protein called PCSK9. This helps your liver remove and clear LDL cholesterol from your blood.\\nFibrates, which lower triglycerides. They may also raise HDL (good) cholesterol. If you take them with statins, they may increase the risk of muscle problems.\\nCombination medicines, which include more than one type of cholesterol-lowering medicine\\n\\nThere are also a few other cholesterol medicines (lomitapide and mipomersen) that are only for people who have familial hypercholesterolemia (FH).

The Dietary Guidelines recommend that most adults eat less than 2.3 grams per day. That equals about 1 teaspoon of table salt a day. Some people are more sensitive to the effects of salt than others and should eat less. This includes people who have high blood pressure, diabetes, or kidney problems, or are African American or over age 50.

The counselor works with you to set goals and provide ideas that may help you make a change.\\n\\nIs treatment for alcohol use disorder effective?\\nFor most people, treatment for an AUD is helpful. But overcoming an alcohol use disorder is an ongoing process, and you may relapse (start drinking again). You should look at relapse as a temporary setback, and keep trying. Many people repeatedly try to cut back or quit drinking, have a setback, then try to quit again. Having a relapse does not mean that you cannot recover. If you do relapse, it is important to return to treatment right away, so you can learn more about your relapse triggers and improve your coping skills.

It plays a role in your immune system and metabolic processes.\\nGood sources of vitamin E include:\\nVegetable oils\\nMargarine\\nNuts and seeds\\nLeafy greens\\n\\nVitamin E is also added to foods like cereals. Most people get enough vitamin E from the foods they eat. People with certain disorders, such as liver diseases, cystic fibrosis, and Crohn's disease may need extra vitamin E. \\nVitamin E supplements may be harmful for people who take blood thinners and other medicines. Check with your health care provider before taking the supplements.\\nNIH: National Institutes of Health Office of Dietary Supplements\\n\",\n",
       " 'Jaundice': '\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nJaundice causes your skin and the whites of your eyes to turn yellow. Too much bilirubin causes jaundice.  Bilirubin is a yellow chemical in hemoglobin, the substance that carries oxygen in your red blood cells. As red blood cells break down, your body builds new cells to replace them. The old ones are processed by the liver. If the liver cannot handle the blood cells as they break down, bilirubin builds up in the body and your skin may look yellow. \\nMany healthy babies have some jaundice during the first week of life.  It usually goes away.   However, jaundice can happen at any age and may be a sign of a problem.  Jaundice can happen for many reasons, such as:\\n\\tBlood diseases\\n\\tGenetic syndromes\\n\\tLiver diseases, such as hepatitis or cirrhosis\\n\\tBlockage of bile ducts \\n\\tInfections \\n\\tMedicines \\n\\n',\n",
       " 'Pregnancy and Nutrition': '\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nWhat is nutrition, and why is it important during pregnancy?\\nNutrition is about eating a healthy and balanced diet so your body gets the nutrients that it needs. Nutrients are substances in foods that our bodies need so they can function and grow. They include carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins, minerals, and water.\\nWhen you\\'re pregnant, nutrition is more important than ever. You need more of many important nutrients than you did before pregnancy. Making healthy food choices every day will help you give your baby what he or she needs to develop. It will also help make sure that you and your baby gain the proper amount of weight.\\nDo I have any special nutrition needs now that I am pregnant?\\nYou need more folic acid, iron, calcium, and vitamin D than you did before pregnancy:\\nFolic acid is a B vitamin that may help prevent certain birth defects. Before pregnancy, you need 400 mcg (micrograms) per day. During pregnancy and when breastfeeding, you need 600 mcg per day from foods or vitamins. It is hard to get this amount from foods alone, so you need to take a supplement that contains folic acid.\\nIron is important for your baby\\'s growth and brain development. During pregnancy, the amount of blood in your body increases, so you need more iron for yourself and your growing baby. You should get 27 mg (milligrams) of iron a day.\\nCalcium during pregnancy can reduce your risk of preeclampsia, a serious medical condition that causes a sudden increase in blood pressure. Calcium also builds up your baby\\'s bones and teeth.\\n\\nPregnant adults should get 1,000 mg (milligrams) of calcium a day\\nPregnant teenagers (ages 14-18) need 1,300 mg of calcium a day\\n\\nVitamin D helps the calcium to build up the baby\\'s bones and teeth. All women, pregnant or not, should be getting 600 IU (international units) of vitamin D per day.\\n\\nKeep in mind that taking too much of a supplement can be harmful. For example, very high levels of vitamin A can cause birth defects. Only take vitamins and mineral supplements that your health care provider recommends.\\nYou also need more protein when you are pregnant. Healthy sources of protein include beans, peas, eggs, lean meats, seafood, and unsalted nuts and seeds.\\nHydration is another special nutritional concern during pregnancy. When you are pregnant, your body needs even more water to stay hydrated and support the life inside you. So it\\'s important to drink enough fluids every day.\\nHow much weight should I gain during my pregnancy?\\nHow much weight you should gain depends on your health and how much you weighed before pregnancy:\\nIf you were at a normal weight before pregnancy, you should gain about 25 to 35 pounds\\nIf you were underweight before pregnancy, you should gain more\\nIf you were overweight or had obesity before you become pregnant, you should gain less\\n\\nCheck with your health care provider to find out how much weight gain during pregnancy is healthy for you. You should gain the weight gradually during your pregnancy, with most of the weight gained in the last trimester.\\nDo I need to eat more calories when I am pregnant?\\nHow many calories you need depends on your weight gain goals. Your health care provider can tell you what your goal should be, based on things like your weight before pregnancy, your age, and how fast you gain weight. The general recommendations are:\\nIn the first trimester of pregnancy, you probably do not need extra calories\\nIn the second trimester, you usually need about 340 extra calories\\nIn the last trimester, you may need around 450 extra calories per day\\nDuring the final weeks of pregnancy, you may not need extra calories\\n\\nKeep in mind that not all calories are equal. You should eat healthy foods that are packed with nutrients - not \"empty calories\" such as those found in soft drinks, candies, and desserts.\\nWhat foods should I avoid during pregnancy?\\nDuring pregnancy, you should avoid:\\nAlcohol. There is no known amount of alcohol that is safe for a woman to drink during pregnancy.\\nFish that may have high levels of mercury. Limit white (albacore) tuna to 6 ounces per week. Do not eat tilefish, shark, swordfish, or king mackerel.\\nFoods that are more likely to contain germs that could cause foodborne illness, including\\n\\t\\nRefrigerated smoked seafood like whitefish, salmon, and mackerel\\nHot dogs or deli meats unless steaming hot\\nRefrigerated meat spreads\\nUnpasteurized milk or juices\\nStore-made salads, such as chicken, egg, or tuna salad\\nUnpasteurized soft cheeses, such as unpasteurized feta, Brie, queso blanco, queso fresco, and blue cheeses\\nRaw sprouts of any kind (including alfalfa, clover, radish, and mung bean)\\n\\n\\nToo much caffeine. Drinking high amounts of caffeine may be harmful for your baby. Small or moderate amounts of caffeine (less than 200 mg (milligrams) per day) appear to be safe during pregnancy. This is the amount in about 12 ounces of coffee. But more research is needed. Check with your health care provider about whether drinking a limited amount of caffeine is okay for you.\\n\\n',\n",
       " 'Overactive Bladder': '\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nOveractive bladder is a condition in which the bladder squeezes urine out at the wrong time. You may have overactive bladder if you have two or more of these symptoms:\\n\\nYou urinate eight or more times a day or two or more times at night\\nYou have the sudden, strong need to urinate immediately\\nYou leak urine after a sudden, strong urge to urinate\\n\\nYou also may have incontinence, a loss of bladder control. Nerve problems, too much fluid, or too much caffeine can cause it. Often the cause is unknown.\\nYour doctor may prescribe a medicine that can calm muscles and nerves. The medicine may come as a pill, a liquid, or a patch. The medicines can cause your eyes to become dry. They can also cause dry mouth and constipation.  To deal with these effects, use eye drops to keep your eyes moist, chew sugarless gum or suck on sugarless hard candy if dry mouth bothers you, and take small sips of water throughout the day.\\nNIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases\\n',\n",
       " 'Health Screening': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nScreenings are tests that look for diseases before you have symptoms. Screening tests can find diseases early, when they're easier to treat. You can get some screenings in your doctor's office. Others need special equipment, so you may need to go to a different office or clinic.\\nSome conditions that doctors commonly screen for include:\\nBreast cancer and cervical cancer in women\\nColorectal cancer\\nDiabetes\\nHigh blood pressure\\nHigh cholesterol\\nOsteoporosis\\nOverweight and obesity\\nProstate cancer in men\\n\\nWhich tests you need depends on your age, your sex, your family history, and whether you have risk factors for certain diseases.  After a screening test, ask when you will get the results and whom to talk to about them.\\nAgency for Healthcare Research and Quality\\n\",\n",
       " 'Concussion': '\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nA concussion is a type of brain injury.  It involves a short loss of normal brain function. It happens when a hit to the head or body causes your head and brain to move rapidly back and forth. This sudden movement can cause the brain to bounce around or twist in the skull, creating chemical changes in your brain. Sometimes it can also stretch and damage your brain cells.\\nSometimes people call a concussion a \"mild\" brain injury. It is important to understand that while concussions may not be life-threatening, they can still be serious.\\nConcussions are a common type of sports injury. Other causes of concussions include blows to the head, bumping your head when you fall, being violently shaken, and car accidents.\\nSymptoms of a concussion may not start right away; they may start days or weeks after the injury. Symptoms may include a headache or neck pain. You may also have nausea, ringing in your ears, dizziness, or tiredness. You may feel dazed or not your normal self for several days or weeks after the injury. Consult your health care professional if any of your symptoms get worse, or if you have more serious symptoms such as:\\nConvulsions or seizures\\nDrowsiness or inability to wake up\\nA headache that gets worse and does not go away\\nWeakness, numbness, or decreased coordination\\nRepeated vomiting or nausea\\nConfusion\\nSlurred speech\\nLoss of consciousness\\n\\nTo diagnose a concussion, your health care provider will do a physical exam and will ask about your injury. You will most likely have a neurological exam, which checks your vision, balance, coordination, and reflexes. Your health care provider may also evaluate your memory and thinking. In some cases, you may also have a scan of the brain, such as a CT scan or an MRI. A scan can check for bleeding or inflammation in the brain, as well as a skull fracture (break in the skull).\\nMost people recover fully after a concussion, but it can take some time. Rest is very important after a concussion because it helps the brain to heal. In the very beginning, you may need to limit physical activities or activities that involve a lot of concentration, such as studying, working on the computer, or playing video games. Doing these may cause concussion symptoms (such as headache or tiredness) to come back or get worse. Then when your health care provider says that it is ok, you can start to return to your normal activities slowly.\\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention\\n',\n",

       " 'Gum Disease': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nIf you have gum disease, you're not alone. Many U.S. adults currently have some form of the disease. It ranges from simple gum inflammation, called gingivitis, to serious damage to the tissue and bone supporting the teeth.   In the worst cases, you can lose teeth.\\nIn gingivitis, the gums become red and swollen. They can bleed easily. Gingivitis is a mild form of gum disease. You can usually reverse it  with daily brushing and flossing and regular cleanings by a dentist or dental hygienist. Untreated gingivitis can lead to periodontitis. If you have periodontitis, the gums pull away from the teeth and form pockets that  become infected. If not treated, the bones, gums and connective tissue that support the teeth are destroyed.\\nNIH: National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research\\n\",\n",

       " 'Aneurysms': '\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nAn aneurysm is a bulge or \"ballooning\" in the wall of an artery. Arteries are blood vessels that carry oxygen-rich blood from the heart to other parts of the body. If an aneurysm grows large, it can burst and cause dangerous bleeding or even death. \\nMost aneurysms occur in the aorta, the main artery that runs from the heart through the chest and abdomen. Aneurysms also can happen in arteries in the brain, heart and other parts of the body. If an aneurysm in the brain bursts, it causes a stroke.\\nAneurysms can develop and become large before causing any symptoms.  Often doctors can stop aneurysms from bursting if they find and treat them early. They use imaging tests to find aneurysms.  Often aneurysms are found by chance during tests done for other reasons.   Medicines and surgery are the two main treatments for aneurysms. \\nNIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute\\n',\n",

In that case, your health care provider may prescribe blood pressure medicines.\\nHow do blood pressure medicines work?\\nBlood pressure medicines work in different ways to lower blood pressure:\\n\\nAngiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) keep your blood vessels from narrowing as much\\nCalcium channel blockers prevent calcium from entering the muscle cells of your heart and blood vessels. This allows the blood vessels to relax.\\nDiuretics remove extra water and sodium (salt) from your body. This lowers the amount of fluid in your blood. Diuretics are often used with other high blood pressure medicines, sometimes in one combined pill.\\nBeta blockers help your heart beat slower and with less force. This means that your heart pumps less blood through your blood vessels. Beta blockers are typically used only as a backup option or if you also have certain other conditions.\\n\\nOften, two or more medicines work better than one. While taking the medicines, it is still important to keep up with your healthy lifestyle changes.\\nNIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute\\n',\n",

Certain jobs such as industrial jobs or hobbies such as carpentry make this type of injury more likely. It's also more likely if you wear contact lenses.\\nChemicals or heat can burn your eyes. With chemicals, the pain may cause you to close your eyes.  This traps the irritant next to the eye and may cause more damage. You should wash out your eye right away while you wait for medical help.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " 'Angina': '\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nAngina is chest pain or discomfort you feel when there is not enough blood flow to your heart muscle. Your heart muscle needs the oxygen that the blood carries. Angina may feel like pressure or a squeezing pain in your chest. It may feel like indigestion. You may also feel pain in your shoulders, arms, neck, jaw, or back. \\nAngina is a symptom of coronary artery disease (CAD), the most common heart disease. CAD happens when a sticky substance called plaque builds up in the arteries that supply blood to the heart, reducing blood flow.\\nThere are three types of angina:\\n\\nStable angina is the most common type. It happens when the heart is working harder than usual. Stable angina has a regular pattern.  Rest and medicines usually help.\\nUnstable angina is the most dangerous. It does not follow a pattern and can happen without physical exertion. It does not go away with rest or medicine. It is a sign that you could have a heart attack soon.\\nVariant angina is rare. It happens when you are resting. Medicines can help.\\n\\nNot all chest pain or discomfort is angina.  If you have chest pain, you should see your health care provider.\\nNIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute\\n',\n",
       " 'Climate Change': '\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nClimate is the average weather in a place over a period of time.  Climate change is major change in temperature, rainfall, snow, or wind patterns lasting for many years.  It can be caused by natural factors or by human activities.  Today climate changes are occurring at an increasingly rapid rate.\\nClimate change can affect our health.  It can lead to:\\nMore heat-related illness and deaths\\nMore pollen, mold, and air pollution.  This can cause an increase in allergies, asthma, and breathing problems.\\nMosquitoes and other insects that carry diseases spreading to areas that used to be too cold for them.\\nMore floods and rising sea levels.  This can cause an increase in contamination of food and water.\\nMore extreme weather events, such as hurricanes and wildfires.  These can cause death, injuries, stress, and mental health problems.\\n\\nResearchers are studying the best ways to lessen climate change and reduce its impact on our health.\\nNIH: National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences\\n',\n",
       " 'Organ Transplantation': '\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nYou may need an organ transplant if one of your organs has failed. This can happen because of illness or injury. When you have an organ transplant, doctors remove an organ from another person and place it in your body.  The organ may come from a living donor or a donor who has died.\\nThe organs that can be transplanted include:\\n Heart \\n\\tIntestine \\n Kidney\\n Liver\\n Lung \\n Pancreas \\n\\nYou often have to wait a long time for an organ transplant. Doctors must match donors to recipients to reduce the risk of transplant rejection. Rejection happens when your immune system attacks the new organ. If you have a transplant, you must take drugs the rest of your life to help keep your body from rejecting the new organ.\\n',\n",
       " 'Spine Injuries and Disorders': '\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nYour backbone, or spine, is made up of 26 bone discs called vertebrae. The vertebrae protect your spinal cord and allow you to stand and bend.  A number of problems can change the structure of the spine or damage the vertebrae and surrounding tissue. They include:\\nInfections\\nInjuries\\nTumors\\nConditions, such as ankylosing spondylitis and scoliosis\\nBone changes that come with age, such as spinal stenosis and herniated disks\\n\\nSpinal diseases often cause pain when bone changes put pressure on the spinal cord or nerves. They can also limit movement. Treatments differ by disease, but sometimes they include back braces and surgery.\\n',\n",
       " 'Rabies': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nRabies is a deadly animal disease caused by a virus. It can happen in wild animals, including raccoons, skunks, bats and foxes, or in dogs, cats or farm animals. People get it from the bite of an infected animal. \\nIn people, symptoms of rabies include fever, headache and fatigue, then confusion, hallucinations and paralysis. Once the symptoms begin, the disease is usually fatal. A series of shots can prevent rabies in people exposed to the virus. You need to get them right away. If an animal bites you, wash the wound well; then get medical care. \\nTo help prevent rabies:\\n\\tVaccinate your pet. Rabies vaccines are available for dogs, cats and farm animals\\n\\tDon't let pets roam\\n\\tDon't approach stray animals. Animals with rabies might be aggressive and vicious, or tired and weak\\n\\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention\\n\",\n",
       " 'Oxygen Therapy': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nWhat is oxygen?\\nOxygen is a gas that your body needs to work properly. Your cells need oxygen to make energy. Your lungs absorb oxygen from the air you breathe. The oxygen enters your blood from your lungs and travels to your organs and body tissues.\\nCertain medical conditions can cause your blood oxygen levels to be too low. Low blood oxygen may make you feel short of breath, tired, or confused. It can also damage your body. Oxygen therapy can help you get more oxygen.\\nWhat is oxygen therapy?\\nOxygen therapy is a treatment that provides you with extra oxygen to breathe in. It is also called supplemental oxygen. It is only available through a prescription from your health care provider. You may get it in the hospital, another medical setting, or at home. Some people only need it for a short period of time. Others will need long-term oxygen therapy.\\nThere are different types of devices that can give you oxygen. Some use tanks of liquid or gas oxygen. Others use an oxygen concentrator, which pulls oxygen out of the air. You will get the oxygen through a nose tube (cannula), a mask, or a tent. The extra oxygen is breathed in along with normal air.\\nThere are portable versions of the tanks and oxygen concentrators. They can make it easier for you to move around while using your therapy.\\nWho needs oxygen therapy?\\nYou may need oxygen therapy if you have a condition that causes low blood oxygen, such as:\\nCOPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease)\\nPneumonia\\nCOVID-19\\nA severe asthma attack\\nLate-stage heart failure\\nCystic fibrosis\\nSleep apnea\\n\\nWhat are the risks of using oxygen therapy?\\nOxygen therapy is generally safe, but it can cause side effects. They include a dry or bloody nose, tiredness, and morning headaches.\\nOxygen poses a fire risk, so you should never smoke or use flammable materials when using oxygen. If you use oxygen tanks, make sure your tank is secured and stays upright. If it falls and cracks or the top breaks off, the tank can fly like a missile.\\nWhat is hyperbaric oxygen therapy?\\nHyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) is a different type of oxygen therapy. It involves breathing oxygen in a pressurized chamber or tube. This allows your lungs to gather up to three times more oxygen than you would get by breathing oxygen at normal air pressure. The extra oxygen moves through your blood and to your organs and body tissues. HBOT is used to treat certain serious wounds, burns, injuries, and infections. It also treats air or gas embolisms (bubbles of air in your bloodstream), decompression sickness suffered by divers, and carbon monoxide poisoning.\\nBut some treatment centers claim that HBOT can treat almost anything, including HIV/AIDS, Alzheimer's disease, autism, and cancer. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not cleared or approved the use of HBOT for these conditions. There are risks to using HBOT, so always check with your primary health care provider before you try it.\\nNIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute\\n\",\n",
       " 'Facial Injuries and Disorders': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nFace injuries and disorders can cause pain and affect how you look. In severe cases, they can affect sight, speech, breathing and your ability to swallow. Fractures (broken bones), especially in the bones of your nose, cheekbone and jaw, are common facial injuries.\\nCertain diseases also lead to facial disorders. For example, nerve diseases like trigeminal neuralgia or Bell's palsy sometimes cause facial pain, spasms and trouble with eye or facial movement. Birth defects can also affect the face. They can cause underdeveloped or unusually prominent facial features or a lack of facial expression. Cleft lip and palate are a common facial birth defect.\\n\",\n",
       " 'CPR': '\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nWhen someone\\'s blood flow or breathing stops, seconds count. Permanent brain damage or death can happen quickly. If you know how to perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), you could save a life. CPR is an emergency procedure for a person whose heart has stopped or is no longer breathing.  CPR can maintain circulation and breathing until emergency medical help  arrives.\\nEven if you haven\\'t had training, you can do \"hands-only\" CPR for a teen or adult whose heart has stopped beating (\"hands-only\" CPR isn\\'t recommended for children).  \"Hands-only\" CPR uses chest compressions to keep blood circulating until emergency help arrives. If you\\'ve had training, you can use chest compressions, clear the airway, and do rescue breathing. Rescue breathing helps get oxygen to the lungs for a person who has stopped breathing.  To keep your skills up, you should repeat the training every two years.\\n',\n",
       " 'Asbestos': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nAsbestos is the name of a group of minerals with long, thin fibers. It was once used widely as insulation. It also occurs in the environment. Asbestos fibers are so small you can't see them. If you disturb asbestos, the fibers can float in the air. This makes them easy to inhale, and some may become lodged in the lungs.\\nIf you breathe in high levels of asbestos over a long period of time, the fibers can build up in the lungs.  This causes scarring and inflammation, and can affect breathing. Eventually it can lead to diseases such as:\\nAsbestosis, or scarring of the lungs that makes it hard to breathe\\nMesothelioma, a rare cancer that affects the lining of the lungs or abdomen\\nLung cancer\\n\\nLung diseases associated with asbestos usually develop over many years. People who become ill from asbestos are usually exposed on the job over long periods of time. Smoking cigarettes increases the risk.\\nAgency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry \\n\",\n",
       " 'Cystic Fibrosis': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nCystic fibrosis (CF) is an inherited disease of the mucus and sweat glands. It affects mostly your lungs, pancreas, liver, intestines, sinuses, and sex organs.  CF causes your mucus to be thick and sticky. The mucus clogs the lungs, causing breathing problems and making it easy for bacteria to grow. This can lead to repeated lung infections and lung damage. \\nThe symptoms and severity of CF can vary. Some people have serious problems from birth. Others have a milder version of the disease that doesn't show up until they are teens or young adults. Sometimes you will have few symptoms, but later you may have more symptoms.\\nCF is diagnosed through various tests, such as gene, blood, and sweat tests. There is no cure for CF, but treatments have improved greatly in recent years. In the past, most deaths from CF were in children and teenagers. Today, with improved treatments, some people who have CF are living into their forties, fifties, or older. Treatments may include chest physical therapy, nutritional and respiratory therapies, medicines, and exercise.\\nNIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute\\n\",\n",
       " 'Gonorrhea': '\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nGonorrhea is a sexually transmitted disease.  It is most common in young adults. The bacteria that cause gonorrhea can infect the genital tract, mouth, or anus. You can get gonorrhea during vaginal, oral, or anal sex with an infected partner.   A pregnant woman can pass it to her baby during childbirth.\\nGonorrhea does not always cause symptoms. In men, gonorrhea can cause pain when urinating and discharge from the penis. If untreated, it can cause problems with the prostate and testicles.\\nIn women, the early symptoms of gonorrhea often are mild. Later, it can cause bleeding between periods, pain when urinating, and increased discharge from the vagina. If untreated, it can lead to pelvic inflammatory disease, which causes problems with pregnancy and infertility.\\nYour health care provider will diagnose gonorrhea with lab tests. Treatment is with antibiotics. Treating gonorrhea is becoming more difficult because drug-resistant strains are increasing. Correct usage of latex condoms greatly reduces, but does not eliminate, the risk of catching or spreading gonorrhea. If your or your partner is allergic to latex, you can use polyurethane condoms. The most reliable way to avoid infection is to not have anal, vaginal, or oral sex.\\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention\\n',\n",
       " 'Burns': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nA burn is damage to your body's tissues caused by heat, chemicals, electricity, sunlight, or radiation. Scalds from hot liquids and steam, building fires and flammable liquids and gases are the most common causes of burns. Another kind is an inhalation injury, caused by breathing smoke.\\nThere are three types of burns:\\n\\nFirst-degree burns damage only the outer layer of skin \\nSecond-degree burns damage the outer layer and the layer underneath\\nThird-degree burns damage or destroy the deepest layer of skin and tissues underneath\\n\\nBurns can cause swelling, blistering, scarring and, in serious cases, shock, and even death. They also can lead to infections because they damage your skin's protective barrier. Treatment for burns depends on the cause of the burn, how deep it is, and how much of the body it covers. Antibiotic creams can prevent or treat infections.  For more serious burns, treatment may be needed to clean the wound, replace the skin, and make sure the patient has enough fluids and nutrition.\\nNIH: National Institute of General Medical Sciences\\n\",\n",
       " 'Tubal Ligation': '\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nTubal ligation (getting your \"tubes tied\") is a type of surgery. It prevents a woman from getting pregnant. It is a permanent form of birth control, and is effective right away.\\nThe surgery cuts, ties, or seals the fallopian tubes. This blocks the path between the ovaries and the uterus. The sperm cannot reach the egg to fertilize it, and the egg cannot reach the uterus. You get the surgery in a hospital or outpatient surgical center. It usually takes about 30 minutes. Almost all women go home the same day. They can return to most normal activities within a few days.\\nTubal ligation can sometimes be reversed. The reversal is major surgery, and does not always work.\\n',\n",
       " 'Friedreich Ataxia': '\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nFriedreich ataxia is an inherited disease that damages your nervous system. The damage affects your spinal cord and the nerves that control muscle movement in your arms and legs.  Symptoms usually begin between the ages of 5 and 15. The main symptom is ataxia, which means trouble coordinating movements. Specific symptoms include:\\nDifficulty walking\\n\\tMuscle weakness\\n\\tSpeech problems\\n\\tInvoluntary eye movements\\n\\tScoliosis (curving of the spine to one side)\\n\\tHeart palpitations, from the heart disease which can happen along with Friedreich ataxia\\n\\nPeople with Friedreich ataxia usually need a wheelchair 15 to 20 years after symptoms first appear.

       " 'Health Risks of an Inactive Lifestyle': '\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nWhat is an inactive lifestyle?\\nBeing a couch potato. Not exercising. A sedentary or inactive lifestyle. You have probably heard of all of these phrases, and they mean the same thing: a lifestyle with a lot of sitting and lying down, with very little to no exercise.\\nIn the United States and around the world, people are spending more and more time doing sedentary activities. During our leisure time, we are often sitting: while using a computer or other device, watching TV, or playing video games. Many of our jobs have become more sedentary, with long days sitting at a desk. And the way most of us get around involves sitting - in cars, on buses, and on trains.\\nHow does an inactive lifestyle affect your body?\\nWhen you have an inactive lifestyle,:\\nYou burn fewer calories. This makes you more likely to gain weight.\\nYou may lose muscle strength and endurance, because you are not using your muscles as much\\nYour bones may get weaker and lose some mineral content\\nYour metabolism may be affected, and your body may have more trouble breaking down fats and sugars\\nYour immune system may not work as well\\nYou may have poorer blood circulation\\nYour body may have more inflammation\\nYou may develop a hormonal imbalance\\n\\nWhat are the health risks of an inactive lifestyle?\\nHaving an inactive lifestyle can be one of the causes of many chronic diseases. By not getting regular exercise, you raise your risk of:\\nObesity\\nHeart diseases, including coronary artery disease and heart attack\\nHigh blood pressure\\nHigh cholesterol\\nStroke\\nMetabolic syndrome\\nType 2 diabetes\\nCertain cancers, including colon, breast, and uterine cancers\\nOsteoporosis and falls\\nIncreased feelings of depression and anxiety\\n\\nHaving a sedentary lifestyle can also raise your risk of premature death. And the more sedentary you are, the higher your health risks are.\\nHow can I get started with exercise?\\nIf you have been inactive, you may need to start slowly. You can keep adding more exercise gradually. The more you can do, the better. But try not to feel overwhelmed, and do what you can. Getting some exercise is always better than getting none. Eventually, your goal can be to get the recommended amount of exercise for your age and health.\\nThere are many different ways to get exercise; it is important to find the types that are best for you. You can also try to add activity to your life in smaller ways, such as at home and at work.\\nHow can I be more active around the house?\\nThere are some ways you can be active around your house:\\nHousework, gardening, and yard work are all physical work. To increase the intensity, you could try doing them at a more vigorous pace.\\nKeep moving while you watch TV. Lift hand weights, do some gentle yoga stretches, or pedal an exercise bike. Instead of using the TV remote, get up and change the channels yourself.\\nWork out at home with a workout video (on your TV or on the internet)\\nGo for a walk in your neighborhood. It can be more fun if you walk your dog, walk your kids to school, or walk with a friend.\\nStand up when talking on the phone\\nGet some exercise equipment for your home. Treadmills and elliptical trainers are great, but not everyone has the money or space for one. Less expensive equipment such as yoga balls, exercise mats, stretch bands, and hand weights can help you get a workout at home too.\\n\\nHow can I be more active at work?\\nMost of us sit when we are working, often in front of a computer. In fact, less than 20% of Americans have physically active jobs. It can be challenging to fit physical activity into your busy workday, but here are some tips to help you get moving:\\nGet up from your chair and move around at least once an hour\\nStand when you are talking on the phone\\nFind out whether your company can get you a stand-up or treadmill desk\\nTake the stairs instead of the elevator\\nUse your break or part of your lunch hour to walk around the building\\nStand up and walk to a colleague\\'s office instead of sending an email\\nHave \"walking\" or standing meetings with co-workers instead of sitting in a conference room\\n\\n',\n",
       " 'Diabetes and Pregnancy': '\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nDiabetes is a disease in which your blood glucose, or blood sugar, levels are too high. When you are pregnant, high blood sugar levels are not good for your baby.\\nAbout seven out of every 100 pregnant women in the United States get gestational diabetes. Gestational diabetes is diabetes that happens for the first time when a woman is pregnant. Most of the time, it goes away after you have your baby. But it does increase your risk for developing type 2 diabetes later on. Your child is also at risk for obesity and type 2 diabetes.\\nMost women get a test to check for diabetes during their second trimester of pregnancy. Women at higher risk may get a test earlier.\\nIf you already have diabetes, the best time to control your blood sugar is before you get pregnant. High blood sugar levels can be harmful to your baby during the first weeks of pregnancy - even before you know you are pregnant. To keep you and your baby healthy, it is important to keep your blood sugar as close to normal as possible before and during pregnancy.\\nEither type of diabetes during pregnancy increases the chances of problems for you and your baby. To help lower the chances talk to your health care team about:\\nA meal plan for your pregnancy\\nA safe exercise plan\\nHow often to test your blood sugar\\nTaking your medicine as prescribed.

Symptoms include bone pain or tenderness, impaired growth, and deformities of the bones and teeth. Your child's doctor uses lab and imaging tests to make the diagnosis. Treatment is replacing the calcium, phosphorus, or vitamin D that are lacking in the diet. Rickets is rare in the United States.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Reflux in Infants': '\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nWhat are reflux (GER) and GERD?\\nThe esophagus is the tube that carries food from your mouth to your stomach. If your baby has reflux, his or her stomach contents come back up into the esophagus. Another name for reflux is gastroesophageal reflux (GER).\\nGERD stands for gastroesophageal reflux disease. It is a more serious and long-lasting type of reflux. Babies may have GERD if their symptoms prevent them from feeding or if the reflux lasts more than 12 to 14 months.\\nWhat causes reflux and GERD in infants?\\nThere is a muscle (the lower esophageal sphincter) that acts as a valve between the esophagus and stomach. When your baby swallows, this muscle relaxes to let food pass from the esophagus to the stomach. This muscle normally stays closed, so the stomach contents don\\'t flow back into the esophagus.\\nIn babies who have reflux, the lower esophageal sphincter muscle is not fully developed and lets the stomach contents back up the esophagus. This causes your baby to spit up (regurgitate). Once his or her sphincter muscle fully develops, your baby should no longer spit up.\\nIn babies who have GERD, the sphincter muscle becomes weak or relaxes when it shouldn\\'t. \\nHow common are reflux and GERD in infants?\\nReflux is very common in babies. About half all babies spit up many times a day in the first 3 months of their lives. They usually stop spitting up between the ages of 12 and 14 months.\\nGERD is also common in younger infants. Many 4-month-olds have it. But by their first birthday, only 10% of babies still have GERD. \\nWhat are the symptoms of reflux and GERD in infants?\\nIn babies, the main symptom of reflux and GERD is spitting up. GERD may also cause symptoms such as:\\nArching of the back, often during or right after eating\\nColic - crying that lasts for more than 3 hours a day with no medical cause\\nCoughing\\nGagging or trouble swallowing\\nIrritability, especially after eating\\nPoor eating or refusing to eat\\nPoor weight gain, or weight loss\\nWheezing or trouble breathing\\nForceful or frequent vomiting\\n\\nNIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases\\nHow do doctors diagnose reflux and GERD in infants?\\nIn most cases, a doctor diagnoses reflux by reviewing your baby\\'s symptoms and medical history. If the symptoms do not get better with feeding changes and anti-reflux medicines, your baby may need testing.\\nSeveral tests can help a doctor diagnose GERD. Sometimes doctors order more than one test to get a diagnosis. Common tests include:\\nUpper GI series, which looks at the shape of your baby\\'s upper GI (gastrointestinal) tract. Your baby will drink or eat a contrast liquid called barium. The barium is mixed in with a bottle or other food. The health care professional will take several x-rays of your baby to track the barium as it goes through the esophagus and stomach.\\nEsophageal pH and impedance monitoring, which measures the amount of acid or liquid in your baby\\'s esophagus. A doctor or nurse places a thin flexible tube through your baby\\'s nose into the stomach. The end of the tube in the esophagus measures when and how much acid comes up into the esophagus. The other end of the tube attaches to a monitor that records the measurements. Your baby will wear this for 24 hours, most likely in the hospital.\\nUpper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy and biopsy, which uses an endoscope, a long, flexible tube with a light and camera at the end of it. The doctor runs the endoscope down your baby\\'s esophagus, stomach, and first part of the small intestine. While looking at the pictures from the endoscope, the doctor may also take tissue samples (biopsy).\\n\\nWhat feeding changes can help treat my infant\\'s reflux or GERD?\\nFeeding changes may help your baby\\'s reflux and GERD:\\nAdd rice cereal to your baby\\'s bottle of formula or breastmilk. Check with the doctor about how much to add. If the mixture is too thick, you can change the nipple size or cut a little \"x\" in the nipple to make the opening larger.\\nBurp your baby after every 1 to 2 ounces of formula. If you breastfeed, burp your baby after nursing from each breast.\\nAvoid overfeeding; give your baby the amount of formula or breast milk recommended.\\nHold your baby upright for 30 minutes after feedings.\\nIf you use formula and your doctor thinks that your baby may be sensitive to milk protein, your doctor may suggest switching to a different type of formula. Do not change formulas without talking to the doctor.\\n\\nWhat treatments might the doctor give for my infant\\'s GERD?\\nIf feeding changes do not help enough, the doctor may recommend medicines to treat GERD. The medicines work by lowering the amount of acid in your baby\\'s stomach. The doctor will only suggest medicine if your baby still has regular GERD symptoms and:\\nYou already tried some feeding changes\\nYour baby has problems sleeping or feeding\\nYour baby does not grow properly\\n\\nThe doctor will often prescribe a medicine on a trial basis and will explain any possible complications. You shouldn\\'t give your baby any medicines unless the doctor tells you to.\\nMedicines for GERD in babies include:\\nH2 blockers, which decrease acid production\\nProton pump inhibitors (PPIs), which lower the amount of acid the stomach makes\\n\\nIf these don\\'t help and your baby still has severe symptoms, then surgery might be an option. Pediatric gastroenterologists only use surgery to treat GERD in babies in rare cases. They may suggest surgery when babies have severe breathing problems or have a physical problem that causes GERD symptoms.\\n',\n",
       " 'Urinary Incontinence': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nWhat is urinary incontinence (UI)?\\nUrinary incontinence (UI) is the loss of bladder control, or being unable to control urination. It is a common condition. It can range from being a minor problem to something that greatly affects your daily life.  In any case, it can get better with proper treatment.\\nWhat are the types of urinary incontinence (UI)?\\nThere are several different types of UI. Each type has different symptoms and causes:\\nStress incontinence happens when stress or pressure on your bladder causes you to leak urine.  This could be due to coughing, sneezing, laughing, lifting something heavy, or physical activity. Causes include weak pelvic floor muscles and the bladder being out of its normal position.\\nUrge, or urgency, incontinence happens when you have a strong urge (need) to urinate, and some urine leaks out before you can make it to the toilet. It is often related to an overactive bladder. Urge incontinence is most common in older people. It can sometimes be a sign of a urinary tract infection (UTI). It can also happen in some neurological conditions, such as multiple sclerosis and spinal cord injuries.\\nOverflow incontinence happens when your bladder doesn't empty all the way. This causes too much urine to stay in your bladder. Your bladder gets too full, and you leak urine. This form of UI is most common in men. Some of the causes include tumors, kidney stones, diabetes, and certain medicines.\\nFunctional incontinence happens when a physical or mental disability, trouble speaking, or some other problem keeps you from getting to the toilet in time. For example, someone with arthritis may have trouble unbuttoning his or her pants, or a person with Alzheimer's disease may not realize they need to plan to use the toilet.\\nMixed incontinence means that you have more than one type of incontinence. It's usually a combination of stress and urge incontinence.\\nTransient incontinence is urine leakage that is caused by a temporary (transient) situation such as an infection or new medicine. Once the cause is removed, the incontinence goes away.\\nBedwetting refers to urine leakage during sleep. This is most common in children, but adults can also have it.\\n   \\nBedwetting is normal for many children. It is more common in boys. Bedwetting is often not considered a health problem, especially when it runs in the family. But if it still happens often at age 5 and older, it may be because of a bladder control problem. This problem could be caused by slow physical development, an illness, making too much urine at night, or another problem. Sometimes there is more than one cause.\\nIn adults, the causes include some medicines, caffeine, and alcohol. It can also be caused by certain health problems, such as diabetes insipidus, a urinary tract infection (UTI), kidney stones, enlarged prostate (BPH), and sleep apnea.\\n\\n\\n\\nWho is at risk for urinary incontinence (UI)?\\nIn adults, you are at higher risk of developing UI if you:\\nAre female, especially after going through pregnancy, childbirth, and/or menopause\\nAre older. As you age, your urinary tract muscles weaken, making it harder to hold in urine.\\nAre a man with prostate problems\\nHave certain health problems, such as diabetes, obesity, or long-lasting constipation\\nAre a smoker\\nHave a birth defect that affects the structure of your urinary tract\\n\\nIn children, bedwetting is more common in younger children, boys, and those whose parents wet the bed when they were children.\\nHow is urinary incontinence (UI) diagnosed?\\nYour health care provider may use many tools to make a diagnosis:\\nA medical history, which includes asking about your symptoms. Your provider may ask you to keep a bladder diary for a few days before your appointment. The bladder diary includes how much and when you drink liquids, when and how much you urinate, and whether you leak urine.\\nA physical exam, which can include a rectal exam. Women may also get a pelvic exam.\\nUrine and/or blood tests\\nBladder function tests\\nImaging tests\\n\\nWhat are the treatments for urinary incontinence (UI)?\\nTreatment depends on the type and cause of your UI. You may need a combination of treatments. Your provider may first suggest self-care treatments, including:\\nLifestyle changes to reduce leaks:\\n        \\nDrinking the right amount of liquid at the right time\\nBeing physically active\\nStaying at a healthy weigh\\nAvoiding constipation\\nNot smoking\\n\\n\\nBladder training. This involves urinating according to a schedule. Your provider makes a schedule from you, based on information from your bladder diary. After you adjust to the schedule, you gradually wait a little longer between trips to the bathroom. This can help stretch your bladder so it can hold more urine.\\nDoing exercises to strengthen your pelvic floor muscles. Strong pelvic floor muscles hold in urine better than weak muscles. The strengthening exercises are called Kegel exercises. They involve tightening and relaxing the muscles that control urine flow.\\n\\nIf these treatments do not work, your provider may suggest other options such as:\\nMedicines, which can be used to\\n        \\nRelax the bladder muscles, to help prevent bladder spasms\\nBlock nerve signals that cause urinary frequency and urgency\\nIn men, shrink the prostate and improve urine flow\\n\\n\\nMedical devices, including\\n        \\nA catheter, which is a tube to carry urine out of the body. You might use one a few times a day or all the time.\\nFor women, a ring or a tampon-like device inserted into the vagina. The devices pushes up against your urethra to help decrease leaks.\\n\\n\\nBulking agents, which are injected into the bladder neck and urethra tissues to thicken them.

It causes the blood vessels to narrow when you are cold or feeling stressed. When this happens, blood can't get to the surface of the skin and the affected areas turn white and blue. When the blood flow returns, the skin turns red and throbs or tingles. In severe cases, loss of blood flow can cause sores or tissue death. \\nPrimary Raynaud's happens on its own. The cause is unknown. There is also secondary Raynaud's, which is caused by injuries, other diseases, or certain medicines.\\nPeople in colder climates are more likely to develop Raynaud's. It is also more common in women, people with a family history, and those over age 30.\\n\\nTreatment for Raynaud's may include drugs to keep the blood vessels open.

       " 'Migraine': '\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nWhat are migraines?\\nMigraines are a recurring type of headache. They cause moderate to severe pain that is throbbing or pulsing. The pain is often on one side of your head. You may also have other symptoms, such as nausea and weakness. You may be sensitive to light and sound.\\nWhat causes migraines?\\nResearchers believe that migraine has a genetic cause. There are also a number of factors that can trigger a migraine. These factors vary from person to person, and they include:\\nStress\\nAnxiety\\nHormonal changes in women\\nBright or flashing lights\\nLoud noises\\nStrong smells\\nMedicines\\nToo much or not enough sleep\\nSudden changes in weather or environment\\nOverexertion (too much physical activity)\\nTobacco\\nCaffeine or caffeine withdrawal\\nSkipped meals\\nMedication overuse (taking medicine for migraines too often)\\n\\nSome people have found that certain foods or ingredients can trigger headaches, especially when they are combined with other triggers. These foods and ingredients include:\\nAlcohol\\nChocolate\\nAged cheeses\\nMonosodium glutamate (MSG)\\nSome fruits and nuts\\nFermented or pickled goods\\nYeast\\nCured or processed meats\\n\\nWho is at risk for migraines?\\nAbout 12% of Americans get migraines. They can affect anyone, but you are more likely to have them if you:\\nAre a woman. Women are three times more likely than men to get migraines.\\nHave a family history of migraines. Most people with migraines have family members who have migraines.\\nHave other medical conditions, such as depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, sleep disorders, and epilepsy.\\n\\nWhat are the symptoms of migraines?\\nThere are four different phases of migraines. You may not always go through every phase each time you have a migraine.:\\nProdome. This phase starts up to 24 hours before you get the migraine. You have early signs and symptoms, such as food cravings, unexplained mood changes, uncontrollable yawning, fluid retention, and increased urination.\\nAura. If you have this phase, you might see flashing or bright lights or zig-zag lines. You may have muscle weakness or feel like you are being touched or grabbed. An aura can happen just before or during a migraine.\\nHeadache. A migraine usually starts gradually and then becomes more severe. It typically causes throbbing or pulsing pain, which is often on one side of your head. But sometimes you can have a migraine without a headache. Other migraine symptoms may include\\n\\nIncreased sensitivity to light, noise, and odors\\nNausea and vomiting\\nWorsened pain when you move, cough, or sneeze\\n\\nPostdrome (following the headache). You may feel exhausted, weak, and confused after a migraine. This can last up to a day.\\n\\nMigraines are more common in the morning; people often wake up with them. Some people have migraines at predictable times, such as before menstruation or on weekends following a stressful week of work.\\nHow are migraines diagnosed?\\nTo make a diagnosis, your health care provider will:\\nTake your medical history\\nAsk about your symptoms\\nDo a physical and neurological exam\\n\\nAn important part of diagnosing migraines is to rule out other medical conditions which could be causing the symptoms. So you may also have blood tests, an MRI or CT scan, or other tests.\\nHow are migraines treated?\\nThere is no cure for migraines. Treatment focuses on relieving symptoms and preventing additional attacks.\\nThere are different types of medicines to relieve symptoms. They include triptan drugs, ergotamine drugs, and pain relievers. The sooner you take the medicine, the more effective it is.\\nThere are also other things you can do to feel better:\\nResting with your eyes closed in a quiet, darkened room\\nPlacing a cool cloth or ice pack on your forehead\\nDrinking fluids\\n\\nThere are some lifestyle changes you can make to prevent migraines:\\nStress management strategies, such as exercise, relaxation techniques, and biofeedback, may reduce the number and severity of migraines. Biofeedback uses electronic devices to teach you to control certain body functions, such as your heartbeat, blood pressure, and muscle tension.\\nMake a log of what seems to trigger your migraines. You can learn what you need to avoid, such as certain foods and medicines. It also help you figure out what you should do, such as establishing a consistent sleep schedule and eating regular meals.\\nHormone therapy may help some women whose migraines seem to be linked to their menstrual cycle\\nIf you have obesity, losing weight may also be helpful\\n\\nIf you have frequent or severe migraines, you may need to take medicines to prevent further attacks. Talk with your health care provider about which drug would be right for you.\\nCertain natural treatments, such as riboflavin (vitamin B2) and coenzyme Q10, may help prevent migraines. If your magnesium level is low, you can try taking magnesium. There is also an herb, butterbur, which some people take to prevent migraines. But butterbur may not be safe for long-term use. Always check with your health care provider before taking any supplements.\\nNIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke\\n',\n",
       " 'Vaccine Safety': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nWhat are vaccines?\\nVaccines play an important role in keeping us healthy. They protect us from serious and sometimes deadly diseases. Vaccines are injections (shots), liquids, pills, or nasal sprays that you take to teach your body's immune system to recognize and defend against harmful germs. The germs could be viruses or bacteria.\\nSome types of vaccines contain germs that cause disease. But the germs have been killed or weakened enough that they won't make you sick. Some vaccines only contain a part of a germ. Other types of vaccines include instructions for your cells to make a protein of the germ.\\nThese different vaccine types all spark an immune response, which helps your body fight off the germs. Your immune system will also remember the germ and attack it if that germ ever invades again. This protection against a certain disease is called immunity.\\nThese diseases can be very serious. Because of this, getting immunity from a vaccine is safer than getting immunity by being sick with the disease. And for a few vaccines, getting vaccinated can actually give you a better immune response than getting the disease would.\\nDo vaccines cause side effects?\\nAs with medicines, any vaccine can cause side effects. Most of the time the side effects are minor, such as a sore arm, fatigue, or mild fever. They usually go away within a few days. These common side effects are often a sign that your body is starting to build immunity against a disease.\\nSerious side effects from vaccines can happen, but they are very rare. These side effects could include a severe allergic reaction. Other possible side effects are different for each vaccine. Talk with your health care provider if you're concerned about your health after getting vaccinated.\\nSome people worry that childhood vaccines could cause autism spectrum disorder (ASD). But many scientific studies have looked at this and have found no link between vaccines and ASD.\\nHow are vaccines tested for safety?\\nEvery vaccine that is approved in the United States goes through extensive safety testing. It starts with testing and evaluation of the vaccine before it's approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This process can often take several years.:\\nFirst, the vaccine is tested in labs. Based on those tests, the FDA decides whether to test the vaccine with people.\\nTesting with people is done through clinical trials. In these trials, the vaccines are tested on volunteers. Clinical trials usually start with 20 to 100 volunteers, but eventually include thousands of volunteers.\\nThe clinical trials have three phases. The trials are looking for the answer to important questions such as \\n\\t\\nIs the vaccine safe?\\nWhat dose (amount) works best?\\nHow does the immune system react to it?\\nHow effective is it?\\n\\n\\nDuring the process, the FDA works closely with the company who makes the vaccine to evaluate the vaccine's safety and effectiveness. If the vaccine is found to be safe and effective, it will be approved and licensed by the FDA.\\nAfter a vaccine is licensed, experts may consider adding it to the recommended vaccine, or immunization, schedule. This schedule is from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). It lists which vaccines are recommended for different groups of people. They list which age groups should get which vaccines, how many doses they need, and when they should get them.\\n\\nTesting and monitoring continue after the vaccine is approved:\\nThe company making the vaccines tests every batch of vaccines for quality and safety. The FDA reviews the results of these tests. It also inspects the factories where the vaccine is made. These checks help make sure the vaccines meet standards for quality and safety.\\nThe FDA, CDC, and other federal agencies continue to monitor its safety, to watch for possible side effects. They have systems to track any safety issues with the vaccines.\\n\\nThese high safety standards and testing help to make sure that vaccines in the United States are safe. Vaccines help protect against serious, even deadly, diseases. They not only protect you, but also help to keep these diseases from spreading to others.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Diabetes Complications': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nWhat is diabetes?\\nIf you have diabetes, your blood glucose, or blood sugar, levels are too high. Glucose comes from the foods you eat. A hormone called insulin helps the glucose get into your cells to give them energy. With type 1 diabetes, your body does not make insulin. With type 2 diabetes, your body does not make or use insulin well. Without enough insulin, the glucose stays in your blood.\\nWhat health problems can diabetes cause?\\nOver time, having too much glucose in your blood can cause complications, including:\\nEye disease, due to changes in fluid levels, swelling in the tissues, and damage to the blood vessels in the eyes\\nFoot problems, caused by damage to the nerves and reduced blood flow to your feet\\nGum disease and other dental problems, because a high amount of blood sugar in your saliva helps harmful bacteria grow in your mouth. The bacteria combine with food to form a soft, sticky film called plaque. Plaque also comes from eating foods that contain sugars or starches. Some types of plaque cause gum disease and bad breath. Other types cause tooth decay and cavities.\\nHeart disease and stroke, caused by damage to your blood vessels and the nerves that control your heart and blood vessels\\nKidney disease, due to damage to the blood vessels in your kidneys. Many people with diabetes develop high blood pressure. That can also damage your kidneys.\\nNerve problems (diabetic neuropathy), caused by damage to the nerves and the small blood vessels that nourish your nerves with oxygen and nutrients\\nSexual and bladder problems, caused by damage to the nerves and reduced blood flow in the genitals and bladder\\nSkin conditions, some of which are caused by changes in the small blood vessels and reduced circulation. People with diabetes are also more likely to have infections, including skin infections.\\n\\nWhat other problems can people with diabetes have?\\nIf you have diabetes, you need to watch out for blood sugar levels that are very high (hyperglycemia) or very low (hypoglycemia). These can happen quickly and can become dangerous. Some of the causes include having another illness or infection and certain medicines. They can also happen if you don't get the right amount of diabetes medicines. To try to prevent these problems, make sure to take your diabetes medicines correctly, follow your diabetic diet, and check your blood sugar regularly.\\nNIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases\\n\",\n",

People with binge-eating disorder keep eating even after they are full. They often eat until they feel very uncomfortable. Afterward, they usually have feelings of guilt, shame, and distress. Eating too much too often can lead to weight gain and obesity. Binge-eating disorder is the most common eating disorder in the U.S.\\nBulimia nervosa. People with bulimia nervosa also have periods of binge-eating. But afterwards, they purge, by making themselves throw up or using laxatives. They may also over-exercise or fast. People with bulimia nervosa may be slightly underweight, normal weight, or overweight.\\nAnorexia nervosa. People with anorexia nervosa avoid food, severely restrict food, or eat very small quantities of only certain foods. They may see themselves as overweight, even when they are dangerously underweight. Anorexia nervosa is the least common of the three eating disorders, but it is often the most serious.

       " 'Emphysema': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nWhat is emphysema?\\nEmphysema is a type of COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). COPD is a group of lung diseases that make it hard to breathe and get worse over time. The other main type of COPD is chronic bronchitis. Most people with COPD have both emphysema and chronic bronchitis, but how severe each type is can be different from person to person.\\nEmphysema affects the air sacs in your lungs. Normally, these sacs are elastic or stretchy. When you breathe in, each air sac fills up with air, like a small balloon. When you breathe out, the air sacs deflate, and the air goes out.\\nIn emphysema, the walls between many of the air sacs in the lungs are damaged. This causes the air sacs to lose their shape and become floppy. The damage also can destroy the walls of the air sacs, leading to fewer and larger air sacs instead of many tiny ones. This makes it harder for your lungs to move oxygen in and carbon dioxide out of your body.\\nWhat causes emphysema?\\nThe cause of emphysema is usually long-term exposure to irritants that damage your lungs and the airways. In the United States, cigarette smoke is the main cause. Pipe, cigar, and other types of tobacco smoke can also cause emphysema, especially if you inhale them.\\nExposure to other inhaled irritants can contribute to emphysema. These include secondhand smoke, air pollution, and chemical fumes or dusts from the environment or workplace.\\nRarely, a genetic condition called alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency can play a role in causing emphysema.\\nWho is at risk for emphysema?\\nThe risk factors for emphysema include:\\nSmoking. This the main risk factor. Up to 75% of people who have emphysema smoke or used to smoke.\\nLong-term exposure to other lung irritants, such as secondhand smoke, air pollution, and chemical fumes and dusts from the environment or workplace.\\nAge. Most people who have emphysema are at least 40 years old when their symptoms begin.\\nGenetics. This includes alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, which is a genetic condition. Also, smokers who get emphysema are more likely to get it if they have a family history of COPD.\\n\\nWhat are the symptoms of emphysema?\\nAt first, you may have no symptoms or only mild symptoms. As the disease gets worse, your symptoms usually become more severe. They can include:\\nFrequent coughing or wheezing\\nA cough that produces a lot mucus\\nShortness of breath, especially with physical activity\\nA whistling or squeaky sound when you breathe\\nTightness in your chest\\n\\nSome people with emphysema get frequent respiratory infections such as colds and the flu. In severe cases, emphysema can cause weight loss, weakness in your lower muscles, and swelling in your ankles, feet, or legs.\\nHow is emphysema diagnosed?\\nYour health care provider may use many tools to make a diagnosis:\\nA medical history, which includes asking about your symptoms\\nA family history\\nOther tests tests, such as lung function tests, a chest x-ray or CT scan, and blood tests\\n\\nWhat are the treatments for emphysema?\\nThere is no cure for emphysema. However, treatments can help with symptoms, slow the progress of the disease, and improve your ability to stay active. There are also treatments to prevent or treat complications of the disease. Treatments include:\\nLifestyle changes, such as\\n\\t\\nQuitting smoking if you are a smoker. This is the most important step you can take to treat emphysema.\\nAvoiding secondhand smoke and places where you might breathe in other lung irritants\\nAsk your health care provider for an eating plan that will meet your nutritional needs. Also ask about how much physical activity you can do. Physical activity can strengthen the muscles that help you breathe and improve your overall wellness.\\n\\n\\nMedicines, such as\\n\\t\\nBronchodilators, which relax the muscles around your airways. This helps open your airways and makes breathing easier. Most bronchodilators are taken through an inhaler. In more severe cases, the inhaler may also contain steroids to reduce inflammation.\\nVaccines for the flu and pneumococcal pneumonia, since people with emphysema are at higher risk for serious problems from these diseases\\nAntibiotics if you get a bacterial or viral lung infection\\n\\n\\nOxygen therapy, if you have severe emphysema and low levels of oxygen in your blood. Oxygen therapy can help you breathe better. You may need extra oxygen all the time or only at certain times.\\nPulmonary rehabilitation, which is a program that helps improve the well-being of people who have chronic breathing problems. It may include\\n\\t\\nAn exercise program\\nDisease management training\\nNutritional counseling\\nPsychological counseling\\n\\n\\nSurgery, usually as a last resort for people who have severe symptoms that have not gotten better with medicines. There are surgeries to \\n\\t\\nRemove damaged lung tissue\\nRemove large air spaces (bullae) that can form when air sacs are destroyed. The bullae can interfere with breathing.\\nDo a lung transplant. This is might be an option if you have very severe emphysema.\\n\\n\\n\\nIf you have emphysema, it's important to know when and where to get help for your symptoms. You should get emergency care if you have severe symptoms, such as trouble catching your breath or talking. Call your health care provider if your symptoms are getting worse or if you have signs of an infection, such as a fever.\\nCan emphysema be prevented?\\nSince smoking causes most cases of emphysema, the best way to prevent it is to not smoke.

It happens when digestive enzymes start digesting the pancreas itself. Pancreatitis can be acute or chronic. Either form is serious and can lead to complications.\\nAcute pancreatitis occurs suddenly and usually goes away in a few days with treatment. It is often caused by gallstones.  Common symptoms are severe pain in the upper abdomen, nausea, and vomiting.   Treatment is usually a few days in the hospital for intravenous (IV) fluids, antibiotics, and medicines to relieve pain.\\nChronic pancreatitis does not heal or improve. It gets worse over time and leads to permanent damage. The most common cause is heavy alcohol use. Other causes include cystic fibrosis and other inherited disorders, high levels of calcium or fats in the blood, some medicines, and autoimmune conditions. Symptoms include nausea, vomiting, weight loss, and oily stools. Treatment may also be a few days in the hospital for intravenous (IV) fluids, medicines to relieve pain, and nutritional support. After that, you may need to start taking enzymes and eat a special diet.  It is also important to not smoke or drink alcohol.\\nNIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases\\n',\n",
       " 'Walking Problems': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nWhat are walking problems?\\nIf you are like most people, you walk thousands of steps each day. You walk to do your daily activities, get around, and exercise. It's something that you usually don't think about. But for those people who have a problem with walking, daily life can be more difficult.\\nWalking problems may cause you to:\\nWalk with your head and neck bent over\\nDrag, drop, or shuffle your feet\\nHave irregular, jerky movements when walking\\nTake smaller steps\\nWaddle\\nWalk more slowly or stiffly\\n\\nWhat causes walking problems?\\nThe pattern of how you walk is called your gait. Many different diseases and conditions can affect your gait and lead to problems with walking. They include:\\nAbnormal development of the muscles or bones of your legs or feet\\nArthritis of the hips, knees, ankles, or feet\\nCerebellar disorders, which are disorders of the area of the brain that controls coordination and balance\\nFoot problems, including corns and calluses, sores, and warts\\nInfections\\nInjuries, such as fractures (broken bones), sprains, and tendinitis\\nMovement disorders, such as Parkinson's disease\\nNeurologic diseases, including multiple sclerosis and peripheral nerve disorders\\nVision problems\\n\\nHow is the cause of a walking problem diagnosed?\\nTo make a diagnosis, your health care provider will ask about your medical history and do a physical exam. This will include checking your bones and muscles and doing a neurological exam. In some cases, you may have other tests, such as lab or imaging tests.\\nWhat are the treatments for walking problems?\\nTreatment of walking problems depends on the cause. Some common types of treatments include:\\nMedicines\\nMobility aids\\nPhysical therapy\\nSurgery\\n\\n\",\n",
       " 'Fatty Liver Disease': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nWhat is fatty liver disease?\\nYour liver is the largest organ inside your body. It helps your body digest food, store energy, and remove poisons. Fatty liver disease is a condition in which fat builds up in your liver. There are two main types:\\nNonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)\\nAlcoholic fatty liver disease, also called alcoholic steatohepatitis\\n\\nWhat is nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)?\\nNAFLD is a type of fatty liver disease that is not related to heavy alcohol use. There are two kinds:\\nSimple fatty liver, in which you have fat in your liver but little or no inflammation or liver cell damage. Simple fatty liver typically does not get bad enough to cause liver damage or complications.\\nNonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), in which you have inflammation and liver cell damage, as well as fat in your liver. Inflammation and liver cell damage can cause fibrosis, or scarring, of the liver. NASH may lead to cirrhosis or liver cancer.\\n\\nWhat is alcoholic fatty liver disease?\\nAlcoholic fatty liver disease is due to heavy alcohol use. Your liver breaks down most of the alcohol you drink, so it can be removed from your body. But the process of breaking it down can generate harmful substances. These substances can damage liver cells, promote inflammation, and weaken your body's natural defenses. The more alcohol that you drink, the more you damage your liver.  Alcoholic fatty liver disease is the earliest stage of alcohol-related liver disease. The next stages are alcoholic hepatitis and cirrhosis.\\nWho is at risk for fatty liver disease?\\nThe cause of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is unknown. Researchers do know that it is more common in people who:\\nHave type 2 diabetes and prediabetes\\nHave obesity\\nAre middle aged or older (although children can also get it)\\nAre Hispanic, followed by non-Hispanic whites. It is less common in African Americans.\\nHave high levels of fats in the blood, such as cholesterol and triglycerides\\nHave high blood pressure\\nTake certain drugs, such as corticosteroids and some cancer drugs\\nHave certain metabolic disorders, including metabolic syndrome\\nHave rapid weight loss\\nHave certain infections, such as hepatitis C\\nHave been exposed to some toxins\\n\\nNAFLD affects about 25% of people in the world. As the rates of obesity, type 2 diabetes, and high cholesterol are rising in the United States, so is the rate of NAFLD. NAFLD is the most common chronic liver disorder in the United States.\\nAlcoholic fatty liver disease only happens in people who are heavy drinkers, especially those who have been drinking for a long period of time. The risk is higher for heavy drinkers who are women, have obesity, or have certain genetic mutations.\\nWhat are the symptoms of fatty liver disease?\\nBoth NAFLD and alcoholic fatty liver disease are usually silent diseases with few or no symptoms. If you do have symptoms, you may feel tired or have discomfort in the upper right side of your abdomen.\\nHow is fatty liver disease diagnosed?\\nBecause there are often no symptoms, it is not easy to find fatty liver disease. Your doctor may suspect that you have it if you get abnormal results on liver tests that you had for other reasons. To make a diagnosis, your doctor will use:\\nYour medical history\\nA physical exam\\nVarious tests, including blood and imaging tests, and sometimes a biopsy\\n\\nAs part of the medical history, your doctor will ask about your alcohol use, to find out whether fat in your liver is a sign of alcoholic fatty liver disease or nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFLD). He or she will also ask which medicines you take, to try to determine whether a medicine is causing your NAFLD.\\nDuring the physical exam, your doctor will examine your body and check your weight and height. Your doctor will look for signs of fatty liver disease, such as:\\nAn enlarged liver\\nSigns of cirrhosis, such as jaundice, a condition that causes your skin and whites of your eyes to turn yellow\\n\\nYou will likely have blood tests, including liver function tests and blood count tests. In some cases you may also have imaging tests, like those that check for fat in the liver and the stiffness of your liver. Liver stiffness can mean fibrosis, which is scarring of the liver. In some cases you may also need a liver biopsy to confirm the diagnosis, and to check how bad the liver damage is.\\nWhat are the treatments for fatty liver disease?\\nDoctors recommend weight loss for nonalcoholic fatty liver. Weight loss can reduce fat in the liver, inflammation, and fibrosis. If your doctor thinks that a certain medicine is the cause of your NAFLD, you should stop taking that medicine.  But check with your doctor before stopping the medicine. You may need to get off the medicine gradually, and you might need to switch to another medicine instead.\\nThere are no medicines that have been approved to treat NAFLD. Studies are investigating whether a certain diabetes medicine or Vitamin E can help, but more studies are needed.\\nThe most important part of treating alcohol-related fatty liver disease is to stop drinking alcohol. If you need help doing that, you may want to see a therapist or participate in an alcohol recovery program. There are also medicines that can help, either by reducing your cravings or making you feel sick if you drink alcohol.\\nBoth alcoholic fatty liver disease and one type of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (nonalcoholic steatohepatitis) can lead to cirrhosis. Doctors can treat the health problems caused by cirrhosis with medicines, operations, and other medical procedures. If the cirrhosis leads to liver failure, you may need a liver transplant.\\nWhat are some lifestyle changes that can help with fatty liver disease?\\nIf you have any of the types of fatty liver disease, there are some lifestyle changes that can help:\\nEat a healthy diet, limiting salt and sugar, plus eating lots of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains\\nGet vaccinations for hepatitis A and B, the flu and pneumococcal disease. If you get hepatitis A or B along with fatty liver, it is more likely to lead to liver failure. People with chronic liver disease are more likely to get infections, so the other two vaccinations are also important.\\nGet regular exercise, which can help you lose weight and reduce fat in the liver\\nTalk with your doctor before using dietary supplements, such as vitamins, or any complementary or alternative medicines or medical practices. Some herbal remedies can damage your liver.\\n\\n\",\n",

       " 'Whooping Cough': '\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nWhat is whooping cough?\\nWhooping cough, or pertussis, is a respiratory infection that can cause coughing fits. In serious cases, the coughing can become violent and rapid. You may cough so hard that you vomit. The name of the disease comes from the whooping noise you might make when you try to breathe in after coughing.\\nWhooping cough is very contagious and can affect anyone. But it can be especially serious in babies who did not yet get the vaccine. About half of babies under age one who get whooping cough need care in the hospital.\\nWhat causes whooping cough?\\nWhooping cough is caused by a type of bacteria called Bordetella pertussis. It spreads from person to person. People who have pertussis usually spread it through coughing, sneezing, or breathing very close to someone. It can also sometimes be spread by touching an infected surface and then touching your nose or mouth.\\nIf you get pertussis, you are contagious for about 2 weeks after you start coughing. Antibiotics may shorten the time that you are contagious.\\nWhat are the symptoms of whooping cough?\\nThe symptoms of pertussis usually start within 5 to 10 days after you are exposed. But sometimes you may not get symptoms until up to 3 weeks later.\\nWhooping cough usually starts with cold-like symptoms. They may last for 1 to 2 weeks and can include:\\nRunny nose\\nMild fever\\nMild, occasional cough\\n\\nThe early symptoms in babies can be different. They may only cough a little bit, or they may not cough at all. Babies may have apnea, which means that there is a pause in breathing. They may start to turn blue. If this happens, get medical care for your baby right away.\\nAs whopping cough gets worse, the symptoms may include:\\nFits of many, rapid coughs followed by a high-pitched \"whoop\" sound\\nVomiting during or after coughing fits\\nExhaustion after coughing fits\\n\\nThe coughing fits get worse and start happening more often, especially at night. You may have them for up to 10 weeks or more.\\nRecovery from this can happen slowly. Your cough gets milder and happens less often. The coughing fits can come back if you have another respiratory infection, even months after you first got whooping cough.\\nHow is whooping cough diagnosed?\\nYour health care provider may use many tools to diagnose whooping cough:\\nA medical history, which includes asking about your symptoms\\nA physical exam\\nA lab test which involves taking a sample of mucus from the back of the throat through the nose. This may be done with a swab or syringe filled with saline. The sample is tested for the bacteria that causes whooping cough.\\nBlood test\\nChest x-ray\\n\\nWhat are the treatments for whooping cough?\\nThe treatment for whooping cough is usually antibiotics. Early treatment is very important. It may make your infection less serious and can also help prevent spreading the disease to others.\\nTreatment after you have been sick for 3 weeks or longer may not help. The bacteria are gone from your body by then, even though you usually still have symptoms. This is because the bacteria have already done damage to your body.\\nWhooping cough can sometimes be very serious and require treatment in the hospital.\\nCan whooping cough be prevented?\\nVaccines are the best way to prevent whooping cough. There are two vaccines in the United States that can help prevent whooping cough: DTaP and Tdap. These vaccines also provide protection against tetanus and diphtheria.\\nBabies and other people at high risk serious disease should be kept away from people who have whooping cough.\\nSometimes health care providers give antibiotics to family members of people who have had whooping cough or people who have been exposed to it. The antibiotics may prevent them from getting the disease.\\nYou may also help prevent the spread of whooping cough (and other respiratory diseases) by:\\nWashing your hands often with soap and water. You can use an alcohol-based hand rub if soap and water are not available.\\nAvoiding touching your face with unwashed hands\\nCleaning and disinfecting surfaces that you frequently touch, including toys\\nCovering coughs and sneezes with a tissue or upper shirt sleeve, not hands\\nStaying home when sick\\nAvoiding close contact with people who are sick\\n\\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention\\n',\n",
       " 'Flu Shot': '\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nFlu is a respiratory infection caused by a number of viruses. Most people with the flu get better on their own. But it can be serious. It can cause complications and sometimes even death.   Getting the flu vaccine every year is the best way to lower your chance of getting the flu and spreading it to others.\\nThe flu vaccine causes antibodies to develop in your body about two weeks after you get it. These antibodies provide protection against infection with the viruses that are in the vaccine.\\nThere are different types of flu shots, including some especially for people 65 and older. Ask your health care provider which one is right for you.\\nEveryone 6 months of age and older should get a flu vaccine every season. People with egg allergies should check with their doctors before getting a vaccine.

       " 'Head and Neck Cancer': '\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nHead and neck cancer includes cancers of the mouth, nose, sinuses, salivary glands, throat, and lymph nodes in the neck. Most begin in the moist tissues that line the mouth, nose, and throat. Symptoms include:\\n\\tA lump or sore that does not heal\\n\\tA sore throat that does not go away\\n\\tTrouble swallowing\\n\\tA change or hoarseness in the voice\\n\\nHead and neck cancers are twice as common in men. Using tobacco or alcohol increases your risk. In fact, around 75% of head and neck cancers are linked to tobacco use, including smoking and smokeless tobacco. Infection with HPV is a risk factor for some head and neck cancers. \\nTo diagnose head and neck cancer, your doctor will do a physical exam and diagnostic tests. You will have a biopsy, where a sample of tissue is taken out and examined under a microscope. It is the only test that can tell for sure if you have cancer.\\nIf found early, these cancers are often curable. Treatments may include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or a combination. Treatments can affect eating, speaking or even breathing, so patients may need rehabilitation.\\nNIH: National Cancer Institute\\n',\n",
       " 'Addison Disease': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nYour adrenal glands are just above your kidneys. The outside layer of these glands makes hormones that help your body respond to stress and regulate your blood pressure and water and salt balance.  Addison disease happens if the adrenal glands don't make enough of these hormones.\\nA problem with your immune system usually causes Addison disease. The immune system mistakenly attacks your own tissues, damaging your adrenal glands. Other causes include infections and cancer.\\nSymptoms include:\\nWeight loss\\t\\nMuscle weakness\\t\\nFatigue that gets worse over time\\t\\nLow blood pressure\\t\\nPatchy or dark skin \\n\\nLab tests can confirm that you have Addison disease.  If you don't treat it, it can be fatal. You will need to take hormone pills for the rest of your life.  If you have Addison disease, you should carry an emergency ID.

       " 'Childbirth Problems': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nChildbirth is the process of giving birth to a baby. It includes labor and delivery. Usually everything goes well, but problems can happen. They may cause a risk to the mother, baby, or both. Some of the more common childbirth problems include:\\nPreterm (premature) labor, when your labor starts before 37 completed weeks of pregnancy\\nPremature rupture of membranes (PROM), when your water breaks too early. If labor does not start soon afterwards, this can raise the risk of infection.\\nProblems with the placenta, such as the placenta covering the cervix, separating from the uterus before birth, or being attached too firmly to the uterus\\nLabor that does not progress, meaning that labor is stalled. This can happen when\\n\\t\\t\\nYour contractions weaken\\nYour cervix does not dilate (open) enough or is taking too long to dilate\\nThe baby is not in the right position\\nThe baby is too big or your pelvis is too small for the baby to move through the birth canal\\n\\n\\nAbnormal heart rate of the baby. Often, an abnormal heart rate is not a problem. But if the heart rate gets very fast or very slow, it can be a sign that your baby is not getting enough oxygen or that there are other problems.\\nProblems with the umbilical cord, such as the cord getting caught on the baby's arm, leg, or neck. It's also a problem if cord comes out before the baby does.\\nProblems with the position of the baby, such as breech, in which the baby is going to come out feet first\\nShoulder dystocia, when the baby's head comes out, but the shoulder gets stuck\\nPerinatal asphyxia, which happens when the baby does not get enough oxygen in the uterus, during labor or delivery, or just after birth\\nPerineal tears, tearing of your vagina and the surrounding tissues\\nExcessive bleeding, which can happen when the delivery causes tears to the uterus or if you are not able to deliver the placenta after you give birth to the baby\\nPost-term pregnancy, when your pregnancy lasts more than 42 weeks\\n\\nIf you have problems in childbirth, your health care provider may need to give you medicines to induce or speed up labor, use tools to help guide the baby out of the birth canal, or deliver the baby by Cesarean section.\\nNIH: National Institute of Child Health and Human Development\\n\",\n",
       " 'Metabolic Syndrome': '\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nWhat is metabolic syndrome?\\nMetabolic syndrome is the name for a group of risk factors for heart disease, diabetes, and other health problems. You can have just one risk factor, but people often have several of them together. When you have at least three of them, it is called metabolic syndrome. These risk factors include:\\nA large waistline, also called abdominal obesity or \"having an apple shape.\" Too much fat around the stomach is a greater risk factor for heart disease than too much fat in other parts of the body.\\nHaving a high triglyceride level. Triglycerides are a type of fat found in the blood.\\nHaving a low HDL cholesterol level. HDL is sometimes called the \"good\" cholesterol because it helps remove cholesterol from your arteries.\\nHaving high blood pressure. If your blood pressure stays high over time, it can damage your heart and lead to other health problems.\\nHaving a high fasting blood sugar. Mildly high blood sugar may be an early sign of diabetes.\\n\\nThe more factors you have, the higher your risk for heart disease, diabetes, and stroke is.\\nWhat causes metabolic syndrome?\\nMetabolic syndrome has several causes that act together:\\nOverweight and obesity\\nAn inactive lifestyle\\nInsulin resistance, a condition in which the body can\\'t use insulin properly. Insulin is a hormone that helps move blood sugar into your cells to give them energy. Insulin resistance can lead to high blood sugar levels.\\nAge - your risk goes up as get older\\nGenetics - ethnicity and family history\\n\\nPeople who have metabolic syndrome often also have excessive blood clotting and inflammation throughout the body. Researchers don\\'t know whether these conditions cause metabolic syndrome or worsen it.\\nWho is at risk for metabolic syndrome?\\nThe most important risk factors for metabolic syndrome are:\\nAbdominal obesity (a large waistline)\\nAn inactive lifestyle\\nInsulin resistance\\n\\nThere are certain groups of people who have an increased risk of metabolic syndrome:\\nSome racial and ethnic groups. Mexican Americans have the highest rate of metabolic syndrome, followed by whites and blacks.\\nPeople who have diabetes\\nPeople who have a sibling or parent who has diabetes\\nWomen with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)\\nPeople who take medicines that cause weight gain or changes in blood pressure, blood cholesterol, and blood sugar levels\\n\\nWhat are the symptoms of metabolic syndrome?\\nMost of the metabolic risk factors have no obvious signs or symptoms, except for a large waistline.\\nHow is metabolic syndrome diagnosed?\\nYour health care provider will diagnose metabolic syndrome based on the results of a physical exam and blood tests. You must have at least three of the risk factors to be diagnosed with metabolic syndrome:\\nA large waistline, which means a waist measurement of \\n\\t\\t\\n35 inches or more for women\\n40 inches or more for men\\n\\n\\nA high triglyceride level, which is 150 mg/dL or higher\\nA low HDL cholesterol level, which is\\n\\t\\t\\nLess than 50 mg/dL for women\\nLess than 40 mg/dL for men\\n\\n\\nHigh blood pressure, which is a reading of 130/85 mmHg or higher.\\nA high fasting blood sugar, which is 100 mg/dL or higher\\n\\nWhat are the treatments for metabolic syndrome?\\nThe most important treatment for metabolic syndrome is a heart-healthy lifestyle, which includes:\\nA heart-healthy eating plan, which limits the amount of saturated and trans fats that you eat. It encourages you to choose a variety of nutritious foods, including fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean meats.\\nAiming for a healthy weight\\nManaging stress\\nGetting regular physical activity\\nQuitting smoking (or not starting if you don\\'t already smoke)\\n\\nIf making lifestyle changes is not enough, you may need to take medicines.

Your esophagus is the muscular tube that carries food and liquids from your mouth to the stomach. If you have EoE, white blood cells called eosinophils build up in your esophagus. This causes damage and inflammation, which can cause pain and may lead to trouble swallowing and food getting stuck in your throat.\\nEoE is rare. But because it is a newly recognized disease, more people are now getting diagnosed with it. Some people who think that they have reflux (GERD) may actually have EoE.\\nWhat causes eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE)?\\nResearchers are not certain about the exact cause of EoE. They think that it is an immune system/allergic reaction to foods or to substances in your environment, such as dust mites, animal dander, pollen, and molds. Certain genes may also play a role in EoE.\\nWho is at risk for eosinophilic esophagitis(EoE)?\\nEoE can affect anyone, but it is more common in people who:\\nAre male\\nAre white\\nHave other allergic diseases, such as hay fever, eczema, asthma and food allergies\\nHave family members with EoE\\n\\nWhat are the symptoms of eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE)?\\nThe most common symptoms of EoE can depend on your age.\\nIn infants and toddlers::\\nFeeding problems\\nVomiting\\nPoor weight gain and growth\\nReflux that does not get better with medicines\\n\\nIn older children::\\nVomiting\\nAbdominal pain\\nTrouble swallowing, especially with solid foods\\nReflux that does not get better with medicines\\nPoor appetite\\n\\nIn adults::\\nTrouble swallowing, especially with solid foods\\nFood getting stuck in the esophagus\\nReflux that does not get better with medicines\\nHeartburn\\nChest pain\\n\\nHow is eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) diagnosed?\\nTo diagnose EoE, your doctor will:\\nAsk about your symptoms and medical history. Since other conditions can have the same symptoms of EoE, it is important for your doctor to take a thorough history.\\nDo an upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy. An endoscope is a long, flexible tube with a light and camera at the end of it. Your doctor will run the endoscope down your esophagus and look at it. Some signs that you might have EoE include white spots, rings, narrowing, and inflammation in the esophagus. However, not everyone with EoE has those signs, and sometimes they can be signs of a different esophagus disorder.\\nDo a biopsy. During the endoscopy, the doctor will take small tissue samples from your esophagus. The samples will be checked for a high number of eosinophils. This is the only way to make a diagnosis of EoE.\\nDo other tests as needed. You may have blood tests to check for other conditions. If you do have EoE, you may have blood or other types of tests to check for specific allergies.\\n\\nWhat are the treatments for eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE)?\\nThere is no cure for EoE. Treatments can manage your symptoms and prevent further damage. The two main types of treatments are medicines and diet.\\nMedicines used to treat EoE are:\\nSteroids, which can help control inflammation. These are usually topical steroids, which you swallow either from an inhaler or as a liquid. Sometimes doctors prescribe oral steroids (pills) to treat people who have serious swallowing problems or weight loss.\\nAcid suppressors such as proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), which may help with reflux symptoms and decrease inflammation.\\n\\nDietary changes for EoE include:\\nElimination diet. If you are on an elimination diet, you stop eating and drinking certain foods and beverages for several weeks. If you are feeling better, you add the foods back to your diet one at a time. You have repeat endoscopies to see whether or not you are tolerating those foods. There are different types of elimination diets:\\n\\nWith one type, you first have an allergy test. Then you stop eating and drinking the foods you are allergic to.\\nFor another type, you eliminate foods and drinks that commonly cause allergies, such as dairy products, egg, wheat, soy, peanuts, tree nuts and fish/shellfish.\\n\\nElemental diet. With this diet, you stop eating and drinking all proteins. Instead, you drink an amino acid formula. Some people who do not like the taste of the formula use a feeding tube instead. If your symptoms and inflammation go away completely, you may be able to try adding foods back one at a time, to see whether you can tolerate them.\\n\\nWhich treatment your health care provider suggests depends on different factors, including your age. Some people may use more than one kind of treatment. Researchers are still trying to understand EoE and how best to treat it.\\nIf your treatment is not working well enough and you have narrowing of the esophagus, you may need dilation. This is a procedure to stretch the esophagus. This makes it easier for you to swallow.\\n',\n",
       " 'Impetigo': '\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nImpetigo is a skin infection caused by bacteria. It is usually caused by staphylococcal (staph) bacteria, but it can also be caused by streptococcal (strep) bacteria. It is most common in children between the ages of two and six. It usually starts when bacteria get into a break in the skin, such as a cut, scratch, or insect bite. \\nSymptoms start with red or pimple-like sores surrounded by red skin. These sores can be anywhere, but usually they occur on your face, arms and legs. The sores fill with pus, then break open after a few days and form a thick crust. They are often itchy, but scratching them can spread the sores. \\nImpetigo can spread by contact with sores or nasal discharge from an infected person. You can treat impetigo with antibiotics. \\n\\n',\n",

Does your child start but not finish things? If so, your child may have attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Nearly everyone shows some of these behaviors at times, but ADHD lasts more than 6 months and causes problems in school, at home and in social situations.\\nADHD is more common in boys than girls. It affects 3 to 5% of all American children.\\nThe main features of ADHD are:\\nInattention\\nHyperactivity\\nImpulsivity\\n\\nNo one knows exactly what causes ADHD. It sometimes runs in families, so genetics may be a factor. There may also be environmental factors.\\nA complete evaluation by a trained professional is the only way to know for sure if your child has ADHD.  Treatment may include medicine to control symptoms, therapy, or both. Structure at home and at school is important. Parent training may also help.\\nNIH: National Institute of Mental Health \\n',\n",
       " 'Autonomic Nervous System Disorders': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nYour autonomic nervous system is the part of your nervous system that controls involuntary actions, such as the beating of your heart and the widening or narrowing of your blood vessels. When something goes wrong in this system, it can cause serious problems, including:\\n\\tBlood pressure problems\\n\\tHeart problems\\n\\tTrouble with breathing and swallowing\\n\\tErectile dysfunction in men\\n\\nAutonomic nervous system disorders can occur alone or as the result of another disease, such as Parkinson's disease, alcoholism and diabetes. Problems can affect either part of the system, as in complex regional pain syndromes, or all of the system. Some types are temporary, but many worsen over time. When they affect your breathing or heart function, these disorders can be life-threatening.\\nSome autonomic nervous system disorders get better when an underlying disease is treated.

       " 'VLDL Cholesterol': '\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nWhat is cholesterol?\\nCholesterol is a waxy, fat-like substance that\\'s found in all the cells in your body. Your liver makes cholesterol, and it is also in some foods, such as meat and dairy products. Your body needs some cholesterol to work properly. But having too much cholesterol in your blood raises your risk of coronary artery disease.\\nWhat is VLDL cholesterol?\\nVLDL stands for very-low-density lipoprotein. Your liver makes VLDL and releases it into your bloodstream. The VLDL particles mainly carry triglycerides, another type of fat, to your tissues. VLDL is similar to LDL cholesterol, but LDL mainly carries cholesterol to your tissues instead of triglycerides.\\nVLDL and LDL are sometimes called \"bad\" cholesterols because they can contribute to the buildup of plaque in your arteries. This buildup is called atherosclerosis. The plaque that builds up is a sticky substance made up of fat, cholesterol, calcium, and other substances found in the blood. Over time, the plaque hardens and narrows your arteries. This limits the flow of oxygen-rich blood to your body. It can lead to coronary artery disease and other heart diseases.\\nHow do I know what my VLDL level is?\\nThere isn\\'t a way to directly measure your VLDL level. Instead, you will most likely get a blood test to measure your triglyceride level. The lab can use your triglyceride level to estimate what your VLDL level is. Your VLDL is about one-fifth of your triglyceride level. However, estimating your VLDL this way does not work if your triglyceride level is very high.\\nWhat should my VLDL level be?\\nYour VLDL level should be less than 30 mg/dL (milligrams per deciliter). Anything higher than that puts you at risk for heart disease and stroke.\\nHow can I lower my VLDL level?\\nSince VLDL and triglycerides are linked, you can lower VLDL level by lowering your triglyceride level. You may be able to lower your triglycerides with a combination of losing weight, diet, and exercise. It is important to switch to healthy fats, and cut back on sugar and alcohol. Some people may also need to take medicines.\\n',\n",
       " 'Congenital Heart Defects': '\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nWhat are congenital heart defects?\\nCongenital heart defects (CHDs) are problems with the structure of the heart. \"Congenital\" means that that the problems are present at birth. These defects happen when a baby\\'s heart doesn\\'t develop normally during pregnancy. Congenital heart defects are the most common type of birth defect.\\nCongenital heart defects can change the way the heart pumps blood. They may make blood flow too slowly, go the wrong way, or block it completely.\\nThere are many types of congenital heart defects. They can happen in one or more parts of the heart. The most common types are:\\n\\nSeptal defects (\"hole in the heart\") - openings in the wall between the left and right sides of the heart\\nHeart valve defects - problems with the valves that control the flow of blood through the heart\\nDefects in the large blood vessels that carry blood in and out of the heart\\n\\nCongenital heart defects can range from very mild problems that never need treatment to life-threatening problems at birth. The most serious congenital heart defects are called critical congenital heart disease. Babies with these defects usually need surgery in the first year of life. But the symptoms of milder heart defects may not show up until childhood or adulthood.\\nWhat causes congenital heart defects?\\nResearchers often don\\'t know what causes congenital heart defects. They do know that changes in a baby\\'s genes sometimes cause a heart defect. The changed genes may come from the parents, or the changes may happen during pregnancy.\\nWho is more likely to have a baby with a congenital heart defect?\\nSeveral things may increase the chance that your baby has a congenital heart defect, such as:\\n\\nYour health before and during pregnancy, including\\n\\t\\nHaving diabetes before pregnancy or developing it in the first 3 months of pregnancy (diabetes that develops later in pregnancy isn\\'t a major risk for heart defects). Carefully controlling your blood sugar before and during pregnancy can lower your baby\\'s risk of congenital heart defects.\\nHaving phenylketonuria (PKU), a rare inherited disorder that affects how the body uses a protein in foods. If you have PKU, eating a low-protein diet before getting pregnant can lower your baby\\'s risk of having a congenital heart defect.\\nHaving rubella (German measles) during pregnancy.\\n\\n\\nYour contact with certain substances during pregnancy, including\\n\\t\\nSmoking or secondhand smoke (breathing smoke from another smoker).\\nCertain medicines, such as angiotensin-converting (ACE) inhibitors for high blood pressure and retinoic acids for acne. If you\\'re pregnant or plan to get pregnant, talk with your health care provider about all the medicines you take.\\n\\n\\nYour family history and genetics. In most cases, congenital heart defects don\\'t run in families. But your chance of having a baby with a congenital heart defect does go up if you or the other parent has a congenital heart defect, or if you already have a child with a congenital heart defect.\\n\\nWhat are the symptoms of congenital heart defects?\\nCongenital heart defects don\\'t cause pain. The signs and symptoms are different, depending on the type and number of defects and how serious they are.\\nCommon signs and symptoms of congenital heart defects include:\\n\\nCyanosis - a bluish color to the skin, lips, and fingernails. It happens when there isn\\'t enough oxygen in the blood\\nFatigue - your baby may be unusually sleepy and may become very tired during feedings\\nPoor blood flow\\nFast or difficult breathing\\nHeart murmur - an unusual sound between heartbeats\\n\\nWhat other problems do congenital heart defects cause?\\nCongenital heart defects don\\'t always cause other problems. If they do, which problems you have would depend on the type and number of defects and how serious the defects are.\\nChildren with congenital heart defects are more likely to:\\n\\nBe smaller than other children\\nHave problems or delays in mental, and emotional growth, and behavior, such as:\\n\\t\\nSpeech and language problems\\nAttention deficit hyperactivity disorders (ADHD)\\n\\n\\n\\nPeople with congenital heart defects may develop other health conditions, including:\\n\\nEndocarditis - an infection of lining of the heart and valves\\nArrhythmia - a problem with the rate or rhythm of your heartbeat\\nHeart failure - when your heart can\\'t pump enough blood to the body\\nPulmonary hypertension - high blood pressure in your lungs\\nKidney and liver disease\\n\\nHow are congenital heart defects diagnosed?\\n\\nBefore a baby is born, your provider may use ultrasound pictures of the baby\\'s heart to look for heart defects. This is called a fetal echocardiogram. It\\'s done between weeks 18 and 22 of pregnancy.\\nDuring the first few days after birth, all newborns are checked for congenital heart defects. A pulse oximeter is clipped to your baby\\'s hands or feet to measure blood oxygen. If it shows low levels of blood oxygen, more tests will be needed to find out if your baby has a heart defect.\\nTo diagnose congenital heart defects in babies, children, and adults, a provider may use many tools, including:\\n\\t\\nA physical exam.\\nCertain heart tests to see how the heart is working.\\nGenetic testing to see if certain gene problems caused the defect.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat are the treatments for congenital heart defects?\\nTreatment depends on the type of congenital heart defect and how serious it is. Possible treatments include:\\n\\nCardiac catheterization to repair simple defects, such as a small hole in the inside wall of the heart. A catheterization uses a thin tube guided through a vein and into the heart.\\nHeart surgery may be needed to:\\n\\t\\nRepair defects in the heart and blood vessels.\\nRepair or replace a heart valve.\\nPlace a device in the chest to help the heart pump blood.\\nDo a heart transplant.\\n\\n\\nMedicine is often used if your baby has a specific type of congenital heart defect called patent ductus arteriosus.\\n\\nAll children and adults who have congenital heart defects need regular follow-up care from a cardiologist (a doctor who specializes in heart diseases) throughout their life, even if their defect was repaired.\\nSome people may need several heart surgeries or catheterizations over the years. They may also need to take medicines to help their hearts work as well as possible.\\nNIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute\\n',\n",
       " 'Tonsillitis': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nWhat are tonsils?\\nTonsils are lumps of tissue at the back of the throat. There are two of them, one on each side. Along with the adenoids, tonsils are part of the lymphatic system. The lymphatic system clears away infection and keeps body fluids in balance.  Tonsils and adenoids work by trapping the germs coming in through the mouth and nose.\\nWhat is tonsillitis?\\nTonsillitis is an inflammation (swelling) of the tonsils. Sometimes along with tonsillitis, the adenoids are also swollen.\\nWhat causes tonsillitis?\\nThe cause of tonsillitis is usually a viral infection. Bacterial infections such as strep throat can also cause tonsillitis.\\nWho is at risk for tonsillitis?\\nTonsillitis is most common in children over age two. Almost every child in the United States gets it at least once. Tonsillitis caused by bacteria is more common in kids ages 5-15. Tonsillitis caused by a virus is more common in younger children.\\nAdults can get tonsillitis, but it is not very common.\\nIs tonsillitis contagious?\\nAlthough tonsillitis is not contagious, the viruses and bacteria that cause it are contagious. Frequent handwashing can help prevent spreading or catching the infections.\\nWhat are the symptoms of tonsillitis?\\nThe symptoms of tonsillitis include:\\nA sore throat, which may be severe\\nRed, swollen tonsils\\nTrouble swallowing\\nA white or yellow coating on the tonsils\\nSwollen glands in the neck\\nFever\\nBad breath\\n\\nWhen does my child need to see a health care provider for tonsillitis?\\nYou should call your health care provider if your child:\\nHas a sore throat for more than two days\\nHas trouble or pain when swallowing\\nFeels very sick or very weak\\n\\nYou should get emergency care right away if your child:\\nHas trouble breathing\\nStarts drooling\\nHas a lot of trouble swallowing\\n\\nHow is tonsillitis diagnosed?\\nTo diagnose tonsillitis, your child's health care provider will first ask you about your child's symptoms and medical history. The provider will look at your child's throat and neck, checking for things such as redness or white spots on the tonsils and swollen lymph nodes.\\nYour child will probably also have one or more tests to check for strep throat, since it can cause tonsillitis and it requires treatment. It could be a rapid strep test, a throat culture, or both. For both tests, the provider uses a cotton swab to collect a sample of fluids from your child's tonsils and the back of the throat. With the rapid strep test, testing is done in the office, and you get the results within minutes. The throat culture is done in a lab, and it usually takes a few days to get the results. The throat culture is a more reliable test. So sometimes if the rapid strep test is negative (meaning that it does not show any strep bacteria), the provider will also do a throat culture just to make sure that your child does not have strep.\\nWhat are the treatments for tonsillitis?\\nTreatment for tonsillitis depends on the cause. If the cause is a virus, there is no medicine to treat it. If the cause is a bacterial infection, such as strep throat, your child will need to take antibiotics. It is important for your child to finish the antibiotics even if he or she feels better. If treatment stops too soon, some bacteria may survive and re-infect your child.\\nNo matter what is causing the tonsillitis, there are some things you can do to help your child feel better. Make sure that your child:\\nGets a lot of rest\\nDrinks plenty of fluids\\nTries eating soft foods if it hurts to swallow\\nTries eating warm liquids or cold foods like popsicles to soothe the throat\\nIsn't around cigarette smoke or do anything else that could irritate the throat\\nSleeps in a room with a humidifier\\nGargles with saltwater\\nSucks on a lozenge (but do not give them to children under four; they can choke on them)\\nTakes an over-the-counter pain reliever such as acetaminophen. Children and teenagers should not take aspirin.\\n\\nIn some cases, your child may need a tonsillectomy.\\nWhat is a tonsillectomy and why might my child need one?\\nA tonsillectomy is surgery to remove the tonsils. Your child might need it if he or she:\\nKeeps getting tonsillitis\\nHas bacterial tonsillitis that does not get better with antibiotics\\nHas tonsils are too big, and are causing trouble breathing or swallowing\\n\\nYour child usually gets the surgery and goes home later that day. Very young children and people who have complications may need to stay in the hospital overnight. It can take a week or two before your child completely recovers from the surgery.\\n\",\n",

Tests that examine the kidney and blood are used to find the tumor.\\nDoctors usually diagnose and remove the tumor in surgery. Other treatments include chemotherapy and radiation and biologic therapies. Biologic therapy boosts your body's own ability to fight cancer.\\nNIH: National Cancer Institute\\n\",\n",
       " 'Vulvar Cancer': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nVulvar cancer is a rare type of cancer. It forms in a woman's external genitals, called the vulva. The cancer usually grows slowly over several years. First, precancerous cells grow on vulvar skin. This is called vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN), or dysplasia. Not all VIN cases turn into cancer, but it is best to treat it early.\\nOften, vulvar cancer doesn't cause symptoms at first. However, see your doctor for testing if you notice:\\nA lump in the vulva\\nVulvar itching or tenderness\\nBleeding that is not your period\\nChanges in the vulvar skin, such as color changes or growths that look like a wart or ulcer\\n\\nYou are at greater risk if you've had a human papillomavirus (HPV) infection or have a history of genital warts. Your health care provider diagnoses vulvar cancer with a physical exam and a biopsy. Treatment varies, depending on your overall health and how advanced the cancer is. It might include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or biologic therapy. Biologic therapy boosts your body's own ability to fight cancer.\\nNIH: National Cancer Institute\\n\",\n",
       " 'Learning Disabilities': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nWhat is a learning disability?\\nLearning disabilities are conditions that affect the ability to learn. They can cause problems with:\\nUnderstanding what people are saying\\nSpeaking\\nReading\\nWriting\\nDoing math\\nPaying attention\\n\\nOften, children have more than one kind of learning disability. They may also have another condition, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), which can make learning even more of a challenge.\\nWhat causes learning disabilities?\\nLearning disabilities don't have anything to do with intelligence. They are caused by differences in the brain, and they affect the way the brain processes information. These differences are usually present at birth. But there are certain factors that can play a role in the development of a learning disability, including:\\nGenetics\\nEnvironmental exposures (such as lead)\\nProblems during pregnancy (such as the mother's drug use)\\n\\nHow do I know if my child has a learning disability?\\nThe earlier you can find and treat a learning disability, the better. Unfortunately, learning disabilities are usually not recognized until a child is in school. If you notice that your child is struggling, talk to your child's teacher or health care provider about an evaluation for a learning disability. The evaluation may include a medical exam, a discussion of family history, and intellectual and school performance testing.\\nWhat are the treatments for learning disabilities?\\nThe most common treatment for learning disabilities is special education. A teacher or other learning specialist can help your child learn skills by building on strengths and finding ways to make up for weaknesses. Educators may try special teaching methods, make changes to the classroom, or use technologies that can assist your child's learning needs. Some children also get help from tutors or speech or language therapists.\\nA child with a learning disability may struggle with low self-esteem, frustration, and other problems. Mental health professionals can help your child understand these feelings, develop coping tools, and build healthy relationships.\\nIf your child has another condition such as ADHD, he or she will need treatment for that condition as well.\\nNIH: National Institute of Child Health and Human Development\\n\",\n",

If you have a problem with the muscles, the eyes don\\'t work properly.\\nThere are many kinds of eye movement disorders. Two common ones are:\\nStrabismus - a disorder in which the two eyes don\\'t line up in the same direction. This results in \"crossed eyes\" or \"walleye.\"\\nNystagmus - fast, uncontrollable movements of the eyes, sometimes called \"dancing eyes\"\\n\\nSome eye movement disorders are present at birth.

       " 'Food Labeling': '\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nAll packaged foods and beverages in the U.S. have food labels. These \"Nutrition Facts\" labels can help you make smarter food choices and eat a healthy diet. \\n\\nBefore you read the food label, you should know a few things:\\nServing size is based on how much people usually eat and drink at one time\\nNumber of servings tells you how many servings are in the container. Some labels will give you information about calories and nutrients for both the whole package and each serving size. But many labels just tell you that information for each serving size. You need to think about the serving size when you decide how much to eat or drink. For example, if a bottle of juice has two servings and you drink the whole bottle, then you are getting twice the amount of sugar that is listed on the label.\\nPercent daily value (%DV) is a number that helps you understand how much of a nutrient is in one serving. Experts recommend that you get certain amount of different nutrients daily. %DV tells you what percentage of the daily recommendation you get from one serving of a food. With this, you can figure out if a food is high or low in a nutrient: 5% or less is low, 20% or more is high.\\n\\nThe information on a food label can help you see how a certain food or drink fits into your overall diet. The label lists, per serving,:\\nThe number of calories\\nFats, including total fat, saturated fat, and trans fat\\nCholesterol\\nSodium\\nCarbohydrates, including fiber, total sugar, and added sugar\\nProtein\\nVitamins and Minerals\\n\\nFood and Drug Administration\\n',\n",
       " 'Marfan Syndrome': '\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nMarfan syndrome is a disorder that affects connective tissue. Connective tissues are proteins that support skin, bones, blood vessels, and other organs. One of these proteins is fibrillin. A problem with the fibrillin gene causes Marfan syndrome. \\nMarfan syndrome can be mild to severe, and the symptoms can vary. People with Marfan syndrome are often very tall, thin, and loose jointed. Most people with Marfan syndrome have heart and blood vessel problems, such as a weakness in the aorta or heart valves that leak. They may also have problems with their bones, eyes, skin, nervous system, and lungs.\\nThere is no specific test for Marfan syndrome. Your doctor may use your medical history, family history, and a physical exam to diagnose it. Marfan syndrome has no cure, but treatments can help delay or prevent complications. Treatments include medicines, surgery, and other therapies.\\nNIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases\\n',\n",
       " 'Stuttering': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nWhat is stuttering?\\nStuttering is a speech disorder. It involves interruptions in the flow of speech. These interruptions are called disfluencies. They may involve:\\nRepeating sounds, syllables, or words\\nStretching out a sound\\nSuddenly stopping in the middle of a syllable or word\\n\\nSometimes, along with the stuttering, there may be nodding, rapid blinking, or trembling lips. The stuttering may be worse when you are stressed, excited, or tired.\\nStuttering can be frustrating, because you know exactly what you want to say, but you have trouble saying it. It can make it difficult to communicate with people. This can cause problems with school, work, and relationships.\\nWhat causes stuttering?\\nThere are two main types of stuttering, and they have different causes:\\nDevelopmental stuttering is the more common type. It starts in young children while they are still learning speech and language skills. Many children stutter when they first start talking. Most of them will outgrow it. But some continue to stutter, and the exact cause is unknown. There are differences in the brains of people who continue to stutter. Genetics may also play a role, since this type of stuttering can run in families.\\nNeurogenic stuttering can happen after someone has a stroke, head trauma, or other type of brain injury. Because of the injury, the brain has trouble coordinating the different parts of the brain involved in speech.\\n\\nWho is at risk for stuttering?\\nStuttering can affect anyone, but it is much more common in boys than girls. Younger children are most likely to stutter. About 75% of children who stutter will get better. For the rest, stuttering can continue their whole lives.\\nHow is stuttering diagnosed?\\nStuttering is usually diagnosed by a speech-language pathologist. This is a health professional who is trained to test and treat people with voice, speech, and language disorders. If you or your child stutters, your regular health care provider may give you a referral to a speech-language pathologist. Or in some cases, a child's teacher may make a referral.\\nTo make a diagnosis, the speech-language pathologist will:\\nLook at the case history, such as when the stuttering was first noticed, how often it happens, and in what situations it happens\\nListen to you or your child speak and analyze the stuttering\\nEvaluate you or your child's speech and language abilities, including the ability to understand and use language\\nAsk about the impact of stuttering on you or your child's life\\nAsk whether stuttering runs in the family\\nFor a child, consider how likely it is that he or she will outgrow it\\n\\nWhat are the treatments for stuttering?\\nThere are different treatments that can help with stuttering. Some of these may help one person but not another. You need to work with the speech-language pathologist to figure out the best plan for you or your child.\\nThe plan should take into account how long the stuttering has been going on and whether there are any other speech or language problems. For a child, the plan should also take into account your child's age and whether he or she is likely to outgrow the stuttering.\\nYounger children may not need therapy right away. Their parents and teachers can learn strategies to help the child practice speaking. That can help some children. As a parent, it's important to be calm and relaxed when your child is speaking. If your child feels pressured, it can make it harder for them to talk. The speech-language pathologist will probably want to evaluate your child regularly, to see whether treatment is needed.\\nSpeech therapy can help children and adults minimize stuttering. Some techniques include:\\nSpeaking more slowly\\nControlling breathing\\nGradually working up from single-syllable responses to longer words and more complex sentences\\n\\nFor adults, self-help groups can help you find resources and support as you face the challenges of stuttering.\\nThere are electronic devices to help with fluency, but more research is needed to see whether they really help over the long term. Some people have tried medicines that usually treat other health problems such as epilepsy, anxiety, or depression. But these medicines are not approved for stuttering, and they often have side effects.\\nNIH: National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders\\n\",\n",
       " 'Macular Degeneration': '\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nMacular degeneration, or age-related macular degeneration (AMD), is a leading cause of vision loss in Americans 60 and older. It is a disease that destroys your sharp, central vision. You need central vision to see objects clearly and to do tasks such as reading and driving. \\nAMD affects the macula, the part of the eye that allows you to see fine detail. It does not hurt, but it causes cells in the macula to die. There are two types: wet and dry. Wet AMD happens when abnormal blood vessels grow under the macula. These new blood vessels often leak blood and fluid. Wet AMD damages the macula quickly. Blurred vision is a common early symptom. Dry AMD happens when the light-sensitive cells in the macula slowly break down. Your gradually lose your central vision. A common early symptom is that straight lines appear crooked.\\nRegular comprehensive eye exams can detect macular degeneration before the disease causes vision loss. Treatment can slow vision loss. It does not restore vision.\\nNIH: National Eye Institute\\n',\n",

Tendinitis is the severe swelling of a tendon.\\nTendinitis usually happens after repeated injury to an area such as the wrist or ankle. It causes pain and soreness around a joint. Some common forms of tendinitis are named after the sports that increase their risk. They include tennis elbow, golfer's elbow, pitcher's shoulder, swimmer's shoulder, and jumper's knee.\\nDoctors diagnose tendinitis with your medical history, a physical exam, and imaging tests. The first step in treatment is to reduce pain and swelling. Rest, wrapping or elevating the affected area, and medicines can help. Ice is helpful for recent, severe injuries. Other treatments include ultrasound, physical therapy, steroid injections, and surgery.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Cytomegalovirus Infections': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nCytomegalovirus (CMV) is a virus found around the world. It is related to the viruses that cause chickenpox and infectious mononucleosis (mono). Between 50% and 80% of adults in the United States have had a CMV infection by age 40. Once CMV is in a person's body, it stays there for life.  \\nCMV is spread through close contact with body fluids. Most people with CMV don't get sick and don't know that they've been infected. But infection with the virus can be serious in babies and people with weak immune systems. If a woman gets CMV when she is pregnant, she can pass it on to her baby. Usually the babies do not have health problems. But some babies can develop lifelong disabilities.\\nA blood test can tell whether a person has ever been infected with CMV. Most people with CMV don't need treatment. If you have a weakened immune system, your doctor may prescribe antiviral medicine. Good hygiene, including proper hand washing, may help prevent infections.\\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention\\n\",\n",

In young children, orthodontic treatment may guide proper jaw growth. This can help permanent teeth to come in properly.  Straight permanent teeth can help prevent tooth problems later on. \\n',\n",
       " 'Childhood Vaccines': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nWhat are vaccines?\\nVaccines are injections (shots), liquids, pills, or nasal sprays that you take to teach the immune system to recognize and defend against harmful germs. The germs could be viruses or bacteria.\\nSome types of vaccines contain germs that cause disease. But the germs have been killed or weakened enough that they won't make your child sick. Some vaccines only contain a part of a germ. Other types of vaccines include instructions for your cells to make a protein of the germ.\\nThese different vaccine types all spark an immune response, which helps the body fight off the germs. Your child's immune system will also remember the germ and attack it if that germ ever invades again. This protection against a certain disease is called immunity.\\nWhy do I need to vaccinate my child?\\nBabies are born with immune systems that can fight most germs, but there are some serious diseases they can't handle. That's why they need vaccines to strengthen their immune system.\\nThese diseases once killed or harmed many infants, children, and adults. But now with vaccines, your child can get immunity from these diseases without having to get sick. And for a few vaccines, getting vaccinated can actually give you a better immune response than getting the disease would. \\nVaccinating your child also protects others. Normally, germs can travel quickly through a community and make a lot of people sick. If enough people get sick, it can lead to an outbreak. But when enough people are vaccinated against a certain disease, it's harder for that disease to spread to others. This means that the entire community is less likely to get the disease.\\nCommunity immunity is especially important for the people who can't get certain vaccines. For example, they may not be able to get a vaccine because they have weakened immune systems. Others may be allergic to certain vaccine ingredients. And newborn babies are too young to get some vaccines. Community immunity can help to protect them all.\\nAre vaccines safe for children?\\nVaccines are safe. They must go through extensive safety testing and evaluation before they are approved in the United States.\\nSome people worry that childhood vaccines could cause autism spectrum disorder (ASD). But many scientific studies have looked at this and have found no link between vaccines and autism.\\nCan vaccines overload my child's immune system?\\nNo, vaccines do not overload the immune system. Every day, a healthy child's immune system successfully fights off thousands of germs. When your child gets vaccines, they are getting weakened or dead germs. So even if they get several vaccines in one day, they are being exposed to a tiny amount of germs compared to what they encounter every day in their environment.\\nWhen do I need to vaccinate my child?\\nYour child will get vaccines during well-child visits. They will be given according to the vaccine schedule. This schedule lists which vaccines are recommended for children. It includes who should get the vaccines, how many doses they need, and at what age they should get them. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) publishes the vaccine schedule.\\nFollowing the vaccine schedule allows your child to get protection from the diseases at exactly the right time. It gives his or her body the chance to build up immunity before being exposed to these very serious diseases.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Eye Care': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nYour eyes are an important part of your health. Most people rely on their eyes to see and make sense of the world around them. But some eye diseases can lead to vision loss, so it is important to identify and treat eye diseases as early as possible. You should get your eyes checked as often as your health care provider recommends it, or if you have any new vision problems. And just as it is important to keep your body healthy, you also need to keep your eyes healthy.\\nEye Care Tips\\nThere are things you can do to help keep your eyes healthy and make sure you are seeing your best:\\n\\nEat a healthy, balanced diet. Your diet should include plenty or fruits and vegetables, especially deep yellow and green leafy vegetables. Eating fish high in omega-3 fatty acids, such as salmon, tuna, and halibut can also help your eyes.\\nMaintain a healthy weight. Being overweight or having obesity increases your risk of developing diabetes. Having diabetes puts you at higher risk of getting diabetic retinopathy or glaucoma.\\nGet regular exercise. Exercise may help to prevent or control diabetes, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol. These diseases can lead to some eye or vision problems. So if you exercise regularly, you can lower your risk of getting these eye and vision problems.\\nWear sunglasses. Sun exposure can damage your eyes and raise your risk of cataracts and age-related macular degeneration. Protect your eyes by using sunglasses that block out 99 to 100% of both UV-A and UV-B radiation.\\nWear protective eye wear. To prevent eye injuries, you need eye protection when playing certain sports, working in jobs such as factory work and construction, and doing repairs or projects in your home.\\nAvoid smoking. Smoking increases the risk of developing age-related eye diseases such as macular degeneration and cataracts and can damage the optic nerve.\\nKnow your family medical history. Some eye diseases are inherited, so it is important to find out whether anyone in your family has had them. This can help you determine if you are at higher risk of developing an eye disease.\\nKnow your other risk factors. As you get older, you are at higher risk of developing age-related eye diseases and conditions. It is important to know you risk factors because you may be able to lower your risk by changing some behaviors.\\nIf you wear contacts, take steps to prevent eye infections. Wash your hands well before you put in or take out your contact lenses. Also follow the instructions on how to properly clean them, and replace them when needed.\\nGive your eyes a rest. If you spend a lot of time using a computer, you can forget to blink your eyes and your eyes can get tired. To reduce eyestrain, try the 20-20-20 rule: Every 20 minutes, look away about 20 feet in front of you for 20 seconds.\\n\\nEye Tests and Exams\\nEveryone needs to have their eyesight tested to check for vision and eye problems. Children usually have vision screening in school or at their health care provider's office during a checkup. Adults may also get vision screenings during their checkups. But many adults need more than a vision screening. They need a comprehensive dilated eye exam.\\nGetting comprehensive dilated eye exams is especially important because some eye diseases may not have warning signs. The exams are the only way to detect these diseases in their early stages, when they are easier to treat.\\nThe exam includes several tests:\\n\\nA visual field test to measure your side (peripheral) vision. A loss of peripheral vision may be a sign of glaucoma.\\nA visual acuity test, where you read an eye chart about 20 feet away, to check on how well you see at various distances\\nTonometry, which measures your eye's interior pressure. It helps to detect glaucoma.\\nDilation, which involves getting eye drops that dilate (widen) your pupils. This allows more light to enter the eye. Your eye care provider examines your eyes using a special magnifying lens. This provides a clear view of important tissues at the back of your eye, including the retina, macula, and optic nerve.\\n\\nIf you have a refractive error and are going to need glasses or contacts, then you will also have a refraction test. When you have this test, you look through a device that has lenses of different strengths to help your eye care professional figure out which lenses will give you the clearest vision.\\nAt what age you should start getting these exams and how often you need them depends on many factors. They include your age, race, and overall health.  For example, if you are African American, you are at higher risk of glaucoma and you need to start getting the exams earlier. If you have diabetes, you should get an exam every year. Check with your health care provider about if and when you need these exams.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Monkeypox Virus Infections': '\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nWhat is monkeypox?\\nMonkeypox is a rare disease caused by infection with the monkeypox virus. The monkeypox virus is in the same family of viruses as the smallpox virus. But monkeypox is less contagious than smallpox. And its disease causes milder symptoms and is usually not fatal.\\nIn the past, most of the people who got monkeypox lived in certain parts of central and western Africa, had traveled there, or had been exposed to infected animals imported from there. During the 2022 outbreak, the disease has been found in people who live in other countries, including the United States.\\nHow does monkeypox spread?\\nMonkeypox spreads in different ways:\\n\\nThrough close, personal, often skin-to-skin contact with someone who has the virus:\\n  \\nThrough direct contact with their rash, scabs, or body fluids\\nBy breathing in the virus during prolonged, face-to-face contact\\nDuring intimate physical contact such as kissing, cuddling, hugging, massage or sex\\n\\n\\nFrom touching items (such as clothes, bedding, or towels) that were used by someone who has the virus\\nDuring pregnancy, from the pregnant person to the baby\\nFrom infected animals:\\n  \\nBy being scratched or bitten by the animal\\nBy preparing or eating meat or using products from the animal\\n\\n\\n\\nSomeone who has monkeypox can spread it from the time their symptoms start until their rash has fully healed, all scabs have fallen off, and a fresh layer of skin has formed.  This usually takes 2-4 weeks. \\nWho is more likely to develop monkeypox?\\nPeople who are more likely to develop monkeypox include those who:\\n\\nHave been identified by public health officials as a contact of someone with monkeypox\\nHad a sexual partner in the past 2 weeks who has been diagnosed with monkeypox\\nHad multiple sexual partners in the past 2 weeks in an area with known monkeypox infections\\nHave jobs that may expose them to monkeypox, such as such as health care providers and laboratory workers who do testing to diagnose monkeypox\\n\\nWhat are the symptoms of monkeypox?\\nThe symptoms of monkeypox usually start within 3 weeks from the time you were exposed to the virus. The symptoms may include:\\n\\nFever.\\nHeadache.\\nMuscle aches and backache.\\nSwollen lymph nodes (\"swollen glands\").\\nChills.\\nExhaustion.\\nA rash with sores that can look like pimples or blisters. It could be on the face, inside the mouth, and on other parts of the body, like the hands, feet, chest, genitals, or anus. It goes through different stages, including scabs, before healing. This can take 2-4 weeks.\\n\\nYou may have all or only a few symptoms:\\n\\nYou may get a rash first, followed by other symptoms\\nYou may have flu-like symptoms and then develop a rash 1-4 days later\\nYou may only get a rash\\n\\nHow is monkeypox diagnosed?\\nTo find out if you have monkeypox, your provider:\\n\\nWill ask about your symptoms and health history.\\nWill look at your rash.\\nWill take a sample of tissue from one of the sores so it can be tested for monkeypox virus.\\nMay do blood tests to check for monkeypox virus or for antibodies to the virus. Antibodies are proteins that your immune system makes to fight foreign substances, such as viruses and bacteria.\\n\\nWhat are the treatments for monkeypox?\\nThere are no treatments specifically for monkeypox, but many people get better on their own.\\nSince monkeypox and smallpox are similar, antiviral medicines that protect against smallpox may also help treat monkeypox. Antiviral medicines may be recommended for people who are more likely to get severely ill, such as patients who have weakened immune systems.\\nCan monkeypox be prevented?\\nThere are steps you can take to help prevent monkeypox:\\n\\nAvoid close, skin-to-skin contact with the monkeypox rash. So, while a person is sick with monkeypox:\\n  \\nDo not touch their rash or scabs.\\nDo not kiss, hug, cuddle, or have sex with them.\\nDo not share eating utensils or cups with them.\\n\\n\\nDo not touch the bedding, towels, or clothing of a person who has monkeypox.\\nWash your hands often with soap and water or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer, especially after contact with sick people.\\nIn Central and West Africa, avoid contact with animals that can spread monkeypox virus, such as rodents and primates. Also, avoid sick or dead animals, as well as any bedding or other materials they have touched.\\n\\nIf you are sick with monkeypox it is recommended that you stay home while you are sick, if possible. If you have an active rash or other symptoms, it would be best to stay in a separate room from your family members and pets if you can.  \\nThe U.S. government has two vaccines in the U.S. to protect against monkeypox. One was approved for smallpox and monkeypox (JYNNEOS), and the other was approved for smallpox (ACAM2000):\\n\\nJYNNEOS is the preferred vaccine to protect against monkeypox. It is a two-dose vaccine.\\nACAM2000 may be an alternative to JYNNEOS. ACAM2000 is a single-dose vaccine. But it has the potential for more side effects and adverse events than JYNNEOS. And it is not recommended for people with severely weakened immune systems and several other conditions.\\n\\nThe U. S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends vaccination for people who have been exposed to monkeypox or who are more likely to get monkeypox.\\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention\\n',\n",
       " 'Bed Bugs': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nBed bugs bite you and feed on your blood. You may have no reaction to the bites, or you may have small marks or itching.  Severe allergic reactions are rare. Bed bugs don't transmit or spread diseases.\\nAdult bed bugs are brown, 1/4 to 3/8 inch long, and have a flat, oval-shaped body. Young bed bugs (called nymphs) are smaller and lighter in color. Bed bugs hide in a variety of places around the bed.  They might also hide in the seams of chairs and couches, between cushions, and in the folds of curtains.  They come out to feed about every five to ten days.  But they can survive over a year without feeding.\\nTo prevent bed bugs in your home:\\n\\nCheck secondhand furniture for any signs of bed bugs before bringing it home\\nUse a protective cover that encases mattresses and box springs.

       " 'Inhalants': '\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nWhat are inhalants?\\nInhalants are substances that people inhale (breathe in) to get high. There are other substances that people might inhale, such as alcohol. But those are not called inhalants, because they can also be used another way. Inhalants are the substances that you can misuse only by inhaling them.\\nUsing inhalants to try to get high, even once, can be very harmful to your brain and body. It can even lead to death.\\nWhat are the types of inhalants?\\nInhalants are often products that are easily bought and can be found in the home or workplace. They contain dangerous substances that have psychoactive (mind-altering) properties when they are inhaled. There are four main types of inhalants are:\\nSolvents, which are liquids that become gas at room temperature. They include paint thinner, nail polish remover, gasoline, and glue.\\nAerosol sprays, such as spray paint, deodorant spray, and vegetable oil sprays\\nGases, including gas from lighters, whipped cream dispensers, and laughing gas\\nNitrites (prescription medicines for chest pain)\\n\\nSome of the common slang terms for various inhalants include:\\nBold\\nLaughing gas\\nPoppers\\nRush\\nSnappers\\nWhippets\\n\\nHow do people use inhalants?\\nPeople who use inhalants breathe in the fumes through their nose or mouth, usually by \"sniffing,\" \"snorting,\" \"bagging,\" or \"huffing.\" It\\'s called different names depending on the substance and equipment used.\\nThe high that inhalants produce usually lasts just a few minutes, so people often try to make it last by inhaling them again and again over several hours.\\nWho uses inhalants?\\nInhalants are mostly used by young kids and teens. They often try inhalants before they try other substances because inhalants are easier to get.\\nWhat are the signs that someone is using inhalants?\\nSigns that someone is using inhalants include:\\nChemical odors on breath or clothing\\nPaint or other stains on face, hands, or clothes\\nHidden empty spray paint or solvent containers and chemical-soaked rags or clothing\\nRed or runny eyes or nose\\nDrunk or disoriented appearance\\nSlurred speech\\nNausea or loss of appetite\\nInattentiveness, lack of coordination, irritability, and depression\\n\\nWhat are the health effects of using inhalants?\\nMost inhalants affect your central nervous system and slow down brain activity. Inhalants can cause both short-term and long-term health effects:\\nShort-term health effects include slurred or distorted speech, lack of coordination, euphoria (feeling \"high\"), dizziness, and hallucinations\\nLong-term health effects may include liver and kidney damage, loss of coordination, limb spasms, delayed behavioral development, and brain damage\\n\\nUsing inhalants, even once, could lead to an overdose. This can cause you to have seizures or your heart to stop. It can also be deadly.\\nAre inhalants addictive?\\nAddiction to inhalants is rare, but it can happen if you use them repeatedly. Stopping them can cause withdrawal symptoms, such as nausea, sweating, problems sleeping, and mood changes.\\nBehavioral therapy may help people who are addicted to inhalants.\\nCan inhalant misuse be prevented?\\nTo try to prevent inhalant abuse, parents should talk to their children about it. They should discuss the dangers of inhalants and how to deal with peer pressure if someone asks them to try it.\\nNIH: National Institute on Drug Abuse\\n',\n",
       " 'Soft Tissue Sarcoma': '\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nYour soft tissues connect, support, or surround other tissues. Examples include your muscles, tendons, fat, and blood vessels. Soft tissue sarcoma is a cancer of these soft tissues. There are many kinds, based on the type of tissue they started in. They may cause a lump or swelling in the soft tissue. Sometimes they spread and can press on nerves and organs, causing problems such as pain or trouble breathing.\\nNo one knows exactly what causes these cancers. They are not common, but you have a higher risk if you have been exposed to certain chemicals, have had radiation therapy, or have certain genetic diseases.\\nDoctors diagnose soft tissue sarcomas with a biopsy. Treatments include surgery to remove the tumor, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or a combination.\\nNIH: National Cancer Institute\\n',\n",
       " 'Thymus Cancer': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nThe thymus is a small organ in your upper chest, under your breastbone. Before birth and during childhood, the thymus helps the body make a type of white blood cell. These cells help protect you from infections. \\nCancer of the thymus is rare. You are more likely to get it if you have other diseases such as myasthenia gravis, lupus or rheumatoid arthritis. Sometimes there are no symptoms.  Other times, thymus cancer can cause:\\nA cough that doesn't go away \\nChest pain\\nTrouble breathing\\n\\nDoctors use a physical exam, imaging tests, and a biopsy to diagnose thymus cancer. The most common treatment is surgery to remove the tumor. Other options include radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and hormone therapy.\\nNIH: National Cancer Institute\\n\",\n",
       " 'Cancer Alternative Therapies': '\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nYou have many choices to make about your cancer treatment. One choice you might be thinking about is complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). CAM is the term for medical products and practices that are not part of standard care.  Examples of CAM therapies are acupuncture, chiropractic, and herbal medicines.\\nPeople with cancer may use CAM to:\\nHelp cope with the side effects of cancer treatments\\nEase worries of cancer treatment and related stress\\nFeel that they are doing something more to help their own care\\n\\nCAM treatments do not work for everyone. Some methods, such as acupuncture, might help with nausea, pain and other side effects of cancer treatment.  Talk to your doctor to make sure that all aspects of your cancer care work together.\\nNIH: National Cancer Institute\\n',\n",
       " 'Noise': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nNoise is all around you, from televisions and radios to lawn mowers and washing machines.  Normally, you hear these sounds at safe levels that don't affect hearing. But sounds that are too loud or loud sounds over a long time are harmful.  They can damage sensitive structures of the inner ear and cause noise-induced hearing loss.\\nMore than 30 million Americans are exposed to hazardous sound levels on a regular basis.  Hazardous sound levels are louder than 80 decibels. That's not as loud as traffic on a busy street. Listening to loud music, especially on headphones, is a common cause of noise-induced hearing loss.  You can protect your hearing by:\\nKeeping the volume down when listening to music\\nWearing earplugs when using loud equipment\\n\\nNIH: National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders\\n\",\n",
       " 'Mild Cognitive Impairment': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nSome forgetfulness can be a normal part of aging.   However, some people have more memory problems than other people their age. This condition is called mild cognitive impairment, or MCI. People with MCI can take care of themselves and do their normal activities.\\nMCI memory problems may include:\\nLosing things often\\nForgetting to go to events and appointments\\nHaving more trouble coming up with words than other people of the same age\\n\\nMemory problems can also have other causes, including certain medicines and diseases that affect the blood vessels that supply the brain. Some of the problems brought on by these conditions can be managed or reversed.\\nYour health care provider can do thinking, memory, and language tests to see if you have MCI. You may also need to see a specialist for more tests. Because MCI may be an early sign of Alzheimer's disease, it's really important to see your health care provider every 6 to 12 months.\\nAt this time, there is no proven drug treatment for MCI. Your health care provider can check to see if you have any changes in your memory or thinking skills over time.\\nNIH: National Institute on Aging\\n\",\n",
       " 'Food Allergy': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nFood allergy is an abnormal response to a food triggered by your body's immune system.\\nIn adults, the foods that most often trigger allergic reactions include fish, shellfish, peanuts, and tree nuts, such as walnuts. Problem foods for children can include eggs, milk, peanuts, tree nuts, soy, and wheat.\\nThe allergic reaction may be mild. In rare cases it can cause a severe reaction called anaphylaxis. Symptoms of food allergy include:\\nItching or swelling in your mouth\\nVomiting, diarrhea, or abdominal cramps and pain\\nHives or eczema\\nTightening of the throat and trouble breathing\\nDrop in blood pressure\\n\\nYour health care provider may use a detailed history, elimination diet, and skin and blood tests to diagnose a food allergy.\\nWhen you have food allergies, you must be prepared to treat an accidental exposure. Wear a medical alert bracelet or necklace, and carry an auto-injector device containing epinephrine (adrenaline).\\nYou can only prevent the symptoms of food allergy by avoiding the food. After you and your health care provider have identified the foods to which you are sensitive, you must remove them from your diet.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " 'Gastrointestinal Bleeding': \"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nYour digestive or gastrointestinal (GI) tract includes the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, large intestine or colon, rectum, and anus. Bleeding can come from any of these areas. The amount of bleeding can be so small that only a lab test can find it. \\nSigns of bleeding in the digestive tract depend where it is and how much bleeding there is.\\nSigns of bleeding in the upper digestive tract include:\\nBright red blood in vomit\\nVomit that looks like coffee grounds\\nBlack or tarry stool\\nDark blood mixed with stool\\n\\nSigns of bleeding in the lower digestive tract include:\\nBlack or tarry stool\\nDark blood mixed with stool\\nStool mixed or coated with bright red blood\\n\\nGI bleeding is not a disease, but a symptom of a disease. There are many possible causes of GI bleeding, including hemorrhoids, peptic ulcers, tears or inflammation in the esophagus, diverticulosis and diverticulitis, ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, colonic polyps, or cancer in the colon, stomach or  esophagus.\\nThe test used most often to look for the cause of GI bleeding is called endoscopy. It uses a flexible instrument inserted through the mouth or rectum to view the inside of the GI tract. A type of endoscopy called colonoscopy looks at the large intestine.\\nNIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases\\n\",\n",
